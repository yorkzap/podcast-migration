        "human_post": "# How to Handle Pricing Objections With Ease\n\nWelcome to our latest episode where we go deeper into the topic of handling pricing objections easier. If you have been selling high expertise services, products, or programs, you may have encountered the popular objection, \"I can't afford it.\" Today, we are going to break down exactly why pricing objections happen and what you need to focus on instead. We'll also share some helpful strategies to overcome this common challenge.\n\n### **Why Pricing Objections Are Not Always Real**\n\nPricing objections are not always genuine. People will find the money for things that are valuable and important to them. What you are selling is an opportunity for your potential customers to make a change in their lives. It's important to understand that their desire for your offer needs to be greater than any fears or doubts they may have. People are often afraid to commit to change, and the easiest way to express this is by stating that you can't afford it.\n\n### **Validating Their Concerns**\n\nWhen a customer presents a pricing objection, it's important to address their concerns without dismissing them. Acknowledge their feelings and ask for permission to go deeper into the conversation. Often, what seems like a pricing objection may actually be a cover for underlying fears or doubts. By engaging in a genuine conversation, you can find out the reasons behind the objection.\n\n### **Is Your Program a Fit?**\n\nAssess whether your program or service is a good fit for your potential customer. Ask them this, without considering money, they see the value in what you offer. This conversation can help them find out if the objection is genuine or if it's a way for the customer to avoid committing to a decision. If it is a genuine fit, explore how you and the customer can work together to make the investment work.\n\n### **Taking a Look at Your Prices**\n\nIf you find yourself still struggling with pricing objections, take a look at your prices. If you are uncomfortable with the prices you are setting, this can manifest in your conversations and trigger objections. Ensure that your prices are set at a point where you are confident in the value you provide. When you are certain that what you deliver is top-notch and is more valuable than the price you are asking for, it becomes powerful.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nRemember, you are in control of your prices, and you have the power to adjust them at any time. It's important to be confident in the value of your offer and to communicate this confidence to your customers. If you need more support in handling pricing objections, get our free resource, where we provide three effective strategies for helping you get through this. Thousands have benefited from this resource, and we hope it will help you too.\n\nHandling pricing objections doesn't have to be scary. With the right mindset and strategies, you can navigate these conversations confidently. Keep in mind that your offer is valuable, and your potential customers need to see and understand that. By approaching pricing objections with confidence, you can guide your customers through their fears and doubts to a place of decision and commitment.\n\n---\nWe hope you found these strategies helpful.

to bring on this show for you as well.\u00a0I never intended to have a career in sales. In fact, I always ran away from sales jobs for as long as I can possibly remember. I'm not a stranger to sales. I'm not a stranger to business and I'm not a stranger to entrepreneurship. In fact, my parents have been entrepreneurs ever since I was, I think ever since I was born. I don't remember anything else other than kind of growing up beside them as they ran their brick and mortar store. However, I found myself going from over 600 million in corporate sales to a 6-figure business.Biggest Takeaways:How I went from being a huge introvert who is also definitely shy of public speaking and doing everything related to crowds to ending up in a sales role.I've had a marriage and two kids and the white picket fence.

sell just as well, if not better than extroverts. After having worked with hundreds if not thousands and thousands of sales professionals back in corporate, what I know to be true is that regardless of your background, experience, age, ethnicity, gender, it really doesn't matter. Introverts have just as much capacity to be able to sell extremely well as extroverts do, if not better.\u00a0\n\nToo often what we think of is that extroverts, the ones who have the big personality, who just seem to have that charismatic nature that draws people to them.\n\nIntroverts can do extremely well in a sales career, in selling in their business and making those sales, especially premium programs or services, is because of their ability to be able to connect in a very unique way.\n\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\n \tContrary to popular belief, introverts have just as much capacity to be able to sell extremely well as extroverts do.\n \tYou hanging in the background during a networking event, observing, listening and figuring who's going to be the best person for you to connect with, is the exact same strategy that you can apply to selling in your business.\n \tYou can structure your business model and set up in a way that allows you to actually shine in your personality as an introvert.\n \tIn selling, your job is to lead the conversation using high quality questions and responding appropriately. This takes a lot of active listening and this is a skill that introverts excel in because of the nature of our personalities.\n\nQuotables:\n\n \tYour ability to connect deeply actually works in your benefit, especially if you're working one-on-one with your clients.\u00a0\n \tSales is an activity of listening.

        "human_post": "# Why You Can Sell Really Well As An Introvert\n\nOn this episode, we will be talking about the topic of introverts and selling. If you've ever felt like being an introvert puts you at a disadvantage when it comes to selling, I'm here to tell you that you are wrong. I believe that introverts can sell just as well, if not better, than extroverts. So let's talk about why.\n\n### **Why your hanging out in the background at networking events is the exact strategy you can apply to selling in your business**\n\nFirst of all, let's debunk the myth that only extroverts with big personalities can excel in sales. The truth is that introverts have a great ability to talk with people in a deep and meaningful way. When introverts go to networking events, they tend to observe and listen, finding the best opportunities to talk with others. This ability to go narrow and deep, and not wide and shallow, is an important skill when it comes to building meaningful connections with potential clients.\n \n### **Why introverts can do extremely well in sales**\n\nIntroverts are great in one-on-one interactions, especially when it comes to providing coaching, consulting, or high-level expertise services. Their amazing listening skills and capacity to read between the lines allow them to form strong connections without having a big, bold personality.\n\nSo how can introverts make use of their strengths in selling? Firstly, they need to align their business model with their personality. For example, a shy introvert might dread regular one-on-one communication with clients and may find a better fit in afiliate marketing or product-based businesses. It's important to find a selling approach that works for you, and introverts have a wide range of options available.\n\n### **The TWO critical pieces you need to manage your energy when selling** \n\nAs an introvert, managing your energy is crucial. Recognize that back-to-back calls can be draining, and create buffers in your schedule to recharge between interactions. Set a maximum number of calls per day to avoid feeling drained, and use scheduling tools to help you implement these boundaries effectively.\n\nWhen it comes to actual sales conversations, active listening is the key. Selling isn't just about asking and telling \u2013 it's about letting the prospect lead the conversation by asking high-quality questions and responding appropriately. Introverts naturally excel in this area, as their introspective nature allows them to pick up on subtle cues and understand when a client is ready to buy.\n\nYou may be surprised to know that I am an introvert myself. Despite shying away from sales early in my career, I've had a successful corporate sales career and now run an online business helping entrepreneurs and small business owners improve their sales skills. If I can do it, so can you!\n\n### **Why sales is really an activity of active listening and how this works really well for you as an introvert**\n\nSo, if you're an introvert struggling with selling in your business, remember that sales is a skill that anyone can learn. It's about understanding the rules, applying yourself, and mastering it through practice. With the right guidance and strategies tailored to your introverted nature, you can build a wonderful business and master the sales game.\n\nI hope this episode has given you some valuable insights and strategies to empower you as an introvert in your sales journey. Remember, your introverted nature is not a limitation \u2013 it's a unique strength that can set you apart in the sales world. Keep selling, and watch your business grow.\n\nThanks for tuning in, and I'll see you on the next episode!",

six-figures in six months, going from the zero list zero audience, zero connections, literally zero everything. In this episode, I'm going to dive into the details of the exact steps I took initially to start my online business, even though I had no Facebook profile before April 2016. I had no plan or intention to actually achieve this milestone. In fact, I was perfectly happy in my corporate career until the point where I could no longer physically do the job and had a breakdown. Here\u2019s how I did it.\n\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\n \tIf you are struggling with clarity, you may be overlooking something that's right there in front of you.\n \tStart by creating content talking about the specific pain points around the problem that you solve for your audience.\n \tIf you spend time, you may find more results, but that's not always the case and it's really about creating those connections. Now from there, so you're engaging these conversations, you're commenting, you're helping, you're answering questions that are in your wheelhouse.\n \tMy calendar blew up I was giving so much value, not only through the posts that I had already built up credibility and expertise in the other communities, but in asking people what they wanted and asking people how I could help serve them. And then delivering upon that with the trainings that I was creating inside my own Facebook community. As a result, people felt heard and validated, understood. And more importantly, they felt connected to me.\n \tIt only took me 20 and a half years to get to six-figures because everything that I learned through my career enabled me to take those shortcuts when I finally put it into practice in my business.\n\n\u00a0\n\nQuotables:\n\n \tThe better you can get at getting clear on who you help and what you do for them, the easier the rest of it comes along and the more that you can get into flow. [Tweet This] (link to: https://ctt.ac/a5Uic)\n \tTake the time to engage in conversations and be helpful. Serve people and help them, then building your business is the byproduct of the way that you are serving.

        "human_post": "# How I Hit 6-Figures in 6 Months\n\nIn this episode, Susan McVea will talk about her journey of going from zero to a six-figure business in just six months. She will dive deeper into the exact steps she took to get to this milestone, even though she had no online presence previously or social media following. Susan's story is a testament that with the right strategy and dedication, it's possible to achieve success in a short time.\n\n## Starting from Zero\n\nSusan didn't have any social media presence before April 2016. She had to figure out how to use platforms like Facebook to build her online business. Despite the challenges, she was able to apply her experience from her corporate career to online business. She used old-fashioned door-to-door, face-to-face, people-to-people conversations \u2013 but in a virtual context, using Facebook groups and communities.\n\n## Finding Clarity and Purpose\n\nOne of the insights Susan shares is the importance of gaining clarity on who you want to help and what you want to help them with. She mentions that this process took her three to four months, emphasizing that clarity is key for the rest of the journey to fall into place. She found out that she wanted to help female entrepreneurs in sales, an area that was underserved and aligned with her skills and values.\n\n## Creating Meaningful Content\n\nSusan's strategy was to give high-value content regularly within Facebook groups, engaging in conversations, and being helpful. She focused on helping people rather than trying to sell to them. By consistently delivering valuable content and engaging in meaningful conversations, she was able to build a following in a short period.\n\n## Leveraging Personal Connections\n\nTo build upon these relationships, Susan invited individuals to custom training sessions within her own Facebook community. These sessions became a platform for delivering even more value and connecting on a personal level. As a result, her calendar filled up with people interested in working with her.\n\n## Embracing Simplicity\n\nWhat's striking about Susan's approach is the simplicity. She didn't rely on elaborate marketing funnels or automation right from the start. Her success was a result of genuine, heart-to-heart conversations and a clear focus on providing value. She emphasizes that keeping things straightforward and genuine can lead to great results.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nSusan's journey to six figures in six months is a wonderful example of how a combination of clarity, purpose, genuine connections, and valuable content can lead to business growth. Her story challenges the notion that success in the online business world requires complex and expensive strategies. Instead, it highlights the power of authenticity and personal connections.\n\nAs Susan puts it, her success was the result of helping people and not just rying to build a business. Her approach of focusing on adding value and building relationships helped her. \n\nTo learn more about the steps Susan took to get to her six-figure milestone, you can access her free resource in the show notes below. It provides a detailed breakdown of her journey, from the first steps to adding in some automated processes, all of which contributed to her success.\n\nTo conclude, Susan's journey shows that success in the online business world is within reach, and it often boils down to the authenticity of connection and the value you provide. If you're looking to start or accelerate your online business, Susan's approach offers a refreshing perspective worth exploring.",

other sales professionals sell over 600 million through my sales career, I\u2019ve learnt that it's very different selling products and services for somebody else on behalf of another person or another company, another brand versus having to sell yourself. If you are somebody who is struggling to sell in your business, perhaps it\u2019s because you're serving, serving, serving and you don't know how to transition that into selling. Serving is selling. On this episode, I\u2019ll teach you how to articulate and understand when to shift that dynamic from giving something for free into giving your audience an opportunity to work with you and, most importantly, pay you.\n\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\n \tSelling requires money. The transformation is in the transaction. And without a transaction there really isn't a transformation.\n \tWhen you have paid for something, it means that you have put your money where your mouth is. The money you spent have been put towards something that is meaningful to you. And when something is meaningful, you are much more likely to pay attention to it.\n \tIf you are currently serving somebody and you are not giving them an opportunity to work with you, you are being completely selfish.\n \tAllow people to have the full ability to choose whether or not they want to partake of the full depth of your gift.\n \tIn order to sell with ease, you need to have very clear boundaries. You need to have very clear ideas of where you are willing to do things and where you aren\u2019t.\n\nQuotables:\n\n \tThere is one constant and that one constant is that serving others is always the golden ticket.

        "human_post": "# You Don't Need To Give Discounts To Get The Deal\n\nHave you ever found yourself in a sales conversation where the potential customer asks for a discount or says they can't afford your services? It's a common challenge, but I'm here to tell you that you don't need to give discounts in order to get the deal. In this blog post, we'll go deeper into why you don't need to discount your prices and what you can do instead to sell with ease.\n\n## Positioning Problem, Not a Pricing Problem\n\nIf you find yourself giving too many discounts, the issue is not your pricing, it's a positioning problem. You need to position yourself as a high-level expert with a value that matches your price. When you have the right positioning and messaging, your customers will expect to pay a premium for your services, which positions you as a go-to expert in your industry.\n\n## Value and Urgent Need\n\nUnderstanding the value you provide to your clients is key. Your unique expertise and the relief you provide to your clients are worth paying for. You also need to identify an urgent need where your service provides the exact solution your potential customers are looking for right now. When you match your value with a urgent need, your potential customers will be less price-sensitive, and they won't require discounts to say yes to your offer.\n\n## Stepping Up as a Sales Leader\n\nIt's important to engage as the leader in the conversation and address potential pricing objections early on. Don't shy away from those conversations or potential objections. Show your sales leadership, ensure your potential customers understand what it looks like to work with you, and exert your expertise right from the beginning.\n\nIf you're struggling with pricing objections on your sales calls, get my free resource with three tried and tested strategies, actual conversation starters, and questions to ask when you hear \"I can't afford it.\" These strategies have helped me, my teams, and my clients turn struggling conversions into standout success.\n\nRemember, you don't need to discount your services to get the deal. Position yourself as a high-level expert, understand your value, and identify urgent needs. When you have that good combination, selling confidently and easily without discounts is a real possibility in the sales process.\n\nSo, don't be afraid to show your sales leadership, engage in conversations, and step up confidently in your pricing discussions.\n\nIf you have more questions, please reach out. I'm here to help you achieve your sales goals by not sacrificing your value.\n\nSo, have the confidence to sell without discounts and watch the yeses come in consistently without having to lower your prices. It's possible, and I'm here to help you every step of the way.\n\nStay confident, and let's make those sales happen!\n\n---\nI've crafted this blog post to provide actionable advice for individuals struggling with pricing objections in sales conversations. The post highlights the importance of positioning, value, urgency, and confidence without using jargon and in a clear, motivational, and empathetic style.

When you have the right positioning and messaging, your customers will expect to pay a premium for your services, which positions you as a go-to expert in your industry.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Value and Urgent Need</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Understanding the value you provide to your clients is key. Your unique expertise and the relief you provide to your clients are worth paying for. You also need to identify an urgent need where your service provides the exact solution your potential customers are looking for right now. When you match your value with a urgent need, your potential customers will be less price-sensitive, and they won't require discounts to say yes to your offer.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Stepping Up as a Sales Leader</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">It's important to engage as the leader in the conversation and address potential pricing objections early on. Don't shy away from those conversations or potential objections. Show your sales leadership, ensure your potential customers understand what it looks like to work with you, and exert your expertise right from the beginning.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">If you're struggling with pricing objections on your sales calls, get my free resource with three tried and tested strategies, actual conversation starters, and questions to ask when you hear \"I can't afford it.\" These strategies have helped me, my teams, and my clients turn struggling conversions into standout success.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Remember, you don't need to discount your services to get the deal. Position yourself as a high-level expert, understand your value, and identify urgent needs. When you have that good combination, selling confidently and easily without discounts is a real possibility in the sales process.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">So, don't be afraid to show your sales leadership, engage in conversations, and step up confidently in your pricing discussions.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">If you have more questions, please reach out. I'm here to help you achieve your sales goals by not sacrificing your value.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">So, have the confidence to sell without discounts and watch the yeses come in consistently without having to lower your prices. It's possible, and I'm here to help you every step of the way.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Stay confident, and let's make those sales happen!</p>\n<hr/>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">I've crafted this blog post to provide actionable advice for individuals struggling with pricing objections in sales conversations. The post highlights the importance of positioning, value, urgency, and confidence without using jargon and in a clear, motivational, and empathetic style.

You're getting frustrated and struggling because you don't know what you're missing in your sales process to actually help them to go over that finish line, to cross the line to finally saying yes. Instead of being on the fence, or worse yet, you know that you can help them, but they don't see how.\u00a0\nIn this episode, we're talking all about the top three reasons why buyers actually say no and don't buy the thing that actually could help solve their problem and get them the solution that they're desperately seeking (which is you!) and how you can actually get them to say yes instead.\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nWhen you have that kind of magic secret sauce for your true ideal clients, it is really going to be magnetic.

        "human_post": "# Why Buyers Say No & How To Hear A Yes!\n\nHave you ever had a sales conversation and wondered why the heck a potential customer isn't just saying yes? You know you can help them, but they seem uncertain. It can be annoying and leave you feeling like you're missing something in your sales process. You're not alone. In this episode, we're diving into the top three reasons why buyers say no and how you can turn those no's into yeses.\n\n## Building Trust\n\nThe first reason buyers say no is because they don't trust you. Trust acts as the foundation of any successful sales relationship. Your customers have to trust that you have a high level of expertise and credibility to help them. It's not just about what you say, but also how consistently you show up, deliver, and show your expertise. Building trust can be as simple as being authentic, transparent, and delivering on your promises.\n\n## Demonstrated Results\n\nThe second reason buyers hesitate to say yes is because they're not sure if your product or service will work for them. This is where social proof, testimonials, and case studies will help. If you have a great record of helping others and delivering results, share that! Sometimes, we downplay our success because it's become routine for us, but it's important for future customers to see the value and potential impact of what you offer.\n\n## Self-Confidence\n\nThe last key reason buyers say no is because they're not sure if they can do it. This is very common for high-ticket items or services requiring a high level of expertise. Potential buyers need to believe that they can achieve the results you promise. Address their concerns by providing clear, realistic expectations, answering FAQs, and making the process as easy as possible. Whether it's time commitment, tech-savviness, or any other barriers, alleviate their self-doubt by demonstrating how achievable success is.\n\nBy addressing these three barriers \u2013 trust, demonstrated results, and self-confidence \u2013 you can optimize your sales process to hear more yeses. Remember, the more you can make potential buyers feel like you're speaking directly to them and their needs, the easier it is for them to say yes.\n\nIf you need more support in understanding and getting over these barriers, I have a lot of resources and tutorials on my Facebook business page that can help you identify and address the reasons why your customers might be holding back from saying yes. It's all about inviting them to consider a different opportunity and being open to their concerns.\n\nIf you're ready to hear more yeses in your business, start by building trust, demonstrating results, and addressing self-confidence. The more you can understand and connect with your potential buyers, the closer you are to turning those no's into a yes!",

Knowing who you want to work with is crucial, as you get to choose your clients.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Needs Analysis</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Identifying the pressing needs of your ideal clients is key. You need to understand their problems better than they do and be able to provide a solution that can address their needs effectively.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Proposal or Presentation</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">The proposal stage is your opportunity to present your offer concisely and make the formal invitation for your potential client to work with you. The key is to customize and provide a brief project scope with clear deliverables, including the price.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Objection Handling</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Learning to handle objections effectively is vital. Objections are part of the sales process, but you need to know how to address them and keep the conversation moving forward.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Closing The Sale</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">As the leader in the conversation, don't shy away from asking for the sale. Make the formal invitation and move the conversation forward, making sure a commitment to move forward and work together.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Follow-Up</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Fortune is in the follow-up. Some prospects may need more time or require many touch points before they make their choice. Nurturing the relationship and continuing the conversation about their needs is critical for building a long lasting connection.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Mastering these important steps will help you close gaps in your sales process and enhance your results. It's about engaging in a two-way relationship and inviting people to co-create with you. By understanding and focusing on the needs of your clients, you'll navigate the sales process more masterfully and build lasting connections with your customers.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">If you found this helpful, let's continue this on social media.

self-care even relate to our business? In this episode, I share the 5 key benefits when you focus on you in your business. We\u2019re going to dive deep into this really short but really impactful conversation. Too often we're focused so much on strategy, which is important. Don't get me wrong because I'm all about strategic thinking and strategy and tactics, but I think we do ourselves a disservice, especially as business owners and leaders when we fail to recognize that we are human beings too.\n\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\n \tWhen you are consistently and constantly taking care of others, and getting burnt out, you're no use to anybody because you're not giving your highest self.\n \tWhen you're pulled in a million directions, when you don't have the time and the energy and just the space, the margin to be able to sit and breathe, have a cup of tea, just ponder and think, and really just allow yourself time to just be, it is much harder to make decisions.\n \tThe best leaders take care of themselves. The best leaders do take the time to put their oxygen mask on because without it, they can't lead.\n\n\u00a0\n\nQuotables:\n\n \tSelf-care is the biggest gift that you can give to yourself in order to help you to generate better results and make more impact the people that you are called to serve. [Tweet This]\n \tLeaders come from a place of abundance, clarity and focus because they're looking at the 30,000 foot level and all of the things that are going on. [Tweet This]\n \tIf you have faith in your ability to stand firm in your leadership to do what's required of you first and then you serve the people that you need to serve, the results will show up.

        "human_post": "# Self-Care = Better Sales Results\n\nAs entrepreneurs and business leaders, it's easy to get caught up in the daily hustle and forget to prioritize self-care. We often think that taking time for ourselves detracts from our business goals, but the truth is that self-care is important for better sales results. In this blog post, we'll talk about how taking care of yourself can lead to more impactful sales and business growth.\n\n## The Benefits of Self-Care\n\n### 1. Less Stress\n\nStress is a silent killer, and it can significantly impact your ability to make sound decisions and drive results. By identifying your stress points and taking steps to reduce or eliminate them, you create a ripple effect of positive change in all areas of your life.\n\n### 2. More Focus\n\nWhen you prioritize self-care, you create room for increased focus. By removing distractions and finding peace and clarity, you place yourself in a position to make smarter, more deliberate decisions that drive better sales outcomes.\n\n### 3. Clarity\n\nHaving the space to think, and just be allows you to make crucial decisions without feeling overwhelmed. When you are clear on your priorities, you can avoid chasing after distractions and focus on what really drives business growth.\n\n### 4. Leadership\n\nGreat leaders take care of themselves. Without self-care, you can't lead effectively. Coming from a place of abundance, clarity, and focus allows you to make bold decisions that positively impact your business and sales outcomes.\n\n### 5. Patience\n\nAlways remember building a business is a marathon, not a sprint. Patience is key, and self-care allows you to nurture the patience needed for sustained success. By taking care of yourself, you'll have  the mental fortitude to stay the course and achieve your long-term business goals.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo conclude, self-care is not a detractor from business success but a critical contributor to it. By taking the time to care for yourself, you set the stage for less stress, increased focus, being able to make better decision, strong leadership, and the patience required for long-term success. Remember, you can't pour from an empty bucket, and prioritizing self-care isn't just about you but also about the better results and positive impact you can have on the people you serve.\n\nSo, make a commitment to yourself today. Prioritize self-care just as much as you prioritize your business goals, and watch as the positive changes spill over into every area of your life. Your bottom line might not see a change right away, but there will be undeniable impact on your mental clarity and well-being. Here's to a more impactful and more successful you!",

actually sell higher priced programs and offers and services? In this episode, we discuss about the different ways that you can sell between transactional selling versus consultative selling and why the consultative selling approach is the best and easiest way to sell.Too often, what I see is that most people use transactional selling. Transactional selling is essentially where there's not a lot of advice or information that is provided to your customer or buyer. They're simply coming in, paying for the service or the product. And that's it. There's not a lot of differentiation between what it is that you offer versus your competitors or alternativesIf you are a service provider, you\u2019d want to sell more in a consultative selling process. This means that you take the role of a trusted advisor and you\u2019re the expert in the transaction. You're acting in an expert capacity to help your customers understand exactly how they can get the solution that they're seeking because you under, you've taken the time to really understand the problem, which ultimately gets you the sale.Biggest Takeaways:Consultative selling means you take on the role of a trusted advisor, you are the expert in the transaction.In a consultative sales process, you are standing in your position of authority and expertise. You are speaking with your potential customer to find out if they are a perfect match for your offer.Your customers will get overwhelmed by too many options, so keep things to one to three options and keep things simple.With a consultative selling approach, you won\u2019t ever feel like you are selling because in essence, you are not selling, you are simple recommending because you are acting in an expert capacity to help your customers understand exactly how they can get the solution they are seeking.Quotables:In your consultative sales process, make things as simple as possible. Encourage your customers to really think through what would a yes look like versus what would a no look like. [Tweet This]\u00a0If they are the right people, they will come back.

        "human_post": "# Consultative vs. Transactional Selling\n\nAre you struggling to sell higher-priced programs, offers, or services? If so, you may need to think about the difference between consultative selling and transactional selling. In this post, we'll discuss the key distinctions and the reason(s) behind why taking the consultative selling approach can be a game-changer for your business.\n\n## Introduction\nWhen it comes to selling, many businesses usually rely on a transactional selling approach. This means just offering a product or service without much guidance or information provided to the customer. But, consultative selling involves taking on the role of a trusted advisor and offering expert advice throughout the sales process.\n\n## Transactional Selling vs. Consultative Selling\nTransactional selling is more about the exchange of goods or services for payment, without taking about the customer's needs or concerns. It usually involves offering a wide range of options and letting the customer decide without any guidance.\n\nConsultative selling, on the other hand, puts you in the position of authority and expertise. You take part in conversations to understand your customer's needs and recommend solutions tailored to their specific situation. By acting as a consultant, you help your customers through the decision-making process, ultimately presenting them with the best option suited to their needs.\n\n## Simplifying the Sales Process\nIn a consultative sales approach, it's important to keep things simple for your customers. Providing them with too many options can lead to decision fatigue and ultimately result in fewer sales. By narrowing the options to one to three choices and giving thoughtful recommendations, you can easily simplify the buying process for your customers.\n\n## Building Trust and Respect\nBy taking the consultative approach, you'll find that you won't feel like you're \"selling\" in the traditional sense. Instead, you'll be seen as a trusted advisor, aiding customers to find the best solutions for their needs. Even if a customer doesn't buy anything, they'll respect your integrity and may even refer others to you, knowing that you genuinely care about serving the right people.\n\n## Setting Yourself Apart\nA consultative sales approach allows you to set yourself apart from the competition. By showing expertise and offering personalized recommendations, you putyourself as a high-level expert in your industry. This can lead to less focus on pricing and more attention on the value you provide to your customers.\n\n## Conclusion\nIf you're struggling to sell higher-priced programs or services, it may be time to go from transactional selling to consultative selling. By taking the time to understand your customer's needs, simplifying the options, and giving thoughtful recommendations, you can build trust, respect, and ultimately increase your sales.

If you're a freelancer or a consultant or a coach and you are working off of the trading time for money model, you should stop, as it\u2019s the fastest route to burnout. Too often, what I see is high level experts like you who want to help more people, but you are caught in this whole hamster race of trading hours for dollars and hours for dollars.\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to talk about value based selling to help you to charge more with your high ticket services and offers.\n\n## What is Value Based Selling?\nValue based selling is based on the outcome or result where the value of the item is very high. It involves selling based on the transformation, outcome, and result, and the price tag is indicative of that total transformation.\n\n## Why Charging by the Hour Doesn't Work\nCharging by the hour does not take into account the expertise and efficiency of the expert. If something is easy for you as the expert, chances are you're taking less time to do it. Your customers are willing to pay a lot to get the solution and to shorten their timeline, especially if it's something that maybe they have been working on or dealing with their entire life.\n\n## How to Create a Value Based Package\nCreating a value based package involves putting everything together and giving everything that the client requires to generate the outcome they want. This approach results in more frequent 'yeses' from your clients and makes it easier to sell high ticket programs.\n\nIn value based selling, it\u2019s not just about convincing the customer, it\u2019s about understanding and tapping into the buyer's psychology and being able to articulate the value in a way that resonates with them.\n\nSo if you\u2019re struggling with pricing or transitioning from hourly rates to value based selling right now, I encourage you to switch over into value based packages and create different levels that people are able to work with you on. It is much easier to sell and charge premium prices that you may be struggling to achieve in your business.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in implementing value based selling, don't hesitate to reach out to me with your specific scenario. I\u2019d love to help you through this transition and see you succeed in your business.\n",

This approach results in more frequent 'yeses' from your clients and makes it easier to sell high ticket programs.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">In value based selling, it\u2019s not just about convincing the customer, it\u2019s about understanding and tapping into the buyer's psychology and being able to articulate the value in a way that resonates with them.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">So if you\u2019re struggling with pricing or transitioning from hourly rates to value based selling right now, I encourage you to switch over into value based packages and create different levels that people are able to work with you on. It is much easier to sell and charge premium prices that you may be struggling to achieve in your business.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">If you\u2019re interested in implementing value based selling, don't hesitate to reach out to me with your specific scenario. I\u2019d love to help you through this transition and see you succeed in your business.</p>\n",

People are focused on how do I close, how do I close, how do I close. Maybe you've even heard The ABC of sales - Always Be Closing. However, I very much believe that it really should be ABS - Always Be Serving, instead of ABC.\n\nIn this episode, we're talking all about why opening the sale is the most crucial part of the sales process and why it will bring you even more sales in the long-term. Selling is serving, and when you sell really well, then you\u2019re serving at the same time. When people have a problem you can solve, they\u2019re naturally going to continue to ask how to work with you. Selling is the opportunity for you to provide your service, programs, products, and solution as a way for your customers to get the help that they need.\n\n## The Opening of the Sale\n\nThe front end part of your sales process, which is the opening, is a combination of your preparation as well as setting the stage and building rapport, making the connection with your ideal customers.\n\n### Preparation\n\nYour preparation is important, but it doesn't have to be overwhelming. If you are selling to B2B or dealing with higher-priced proposals, more time in preparation may be needed. As you get more experience, your preparation time will decrease. It's key to be extra prepared when you're engaging with potential customers.\n\n### Setting the Stage\n\nSetting an agenda for your sales conversation and having clear expectations for what the conversation is supposed to look like based on what you want is crucial. You are in charge of this conversation, and if you don't set the tone, it tends to go haywire.\n\n### Creating Rapport\n\nBuilding rapport is all about being able to relate to your customer on a personal level. People buy from those that they know, like, and trust. If they don\u2019t like you very much, especially in high-level services, there would be a huge disconnect. Building rapport creates the foundation for a meaningful relationship with your customers.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThe opening of the sale sets the tone for the relationship that you\u2019re going to have with your customers, whether or not they buy from you now or later or never. It's what makes people feel connected and sets you apart, making you even more memorable. Selling with integrity creates powerful word-of-mouth marketing for your business, even from people who may never buy from you.\n\nRemember, nobody wants to be pushed through with their credit card. They want to know that they matter even if they don\u2019t end up working with you. Opening the sale in a genuine, authentic, deep, and meaningful way is critical for long-term business growth.\n\nSo, next time you're preparing for a sales conversation, don't rush through the opening. Take the time to make a genuine connection, set the stage, and build rapport. The quality of your conversations will increase and you'll be setting yourself up for long-term success.\n\nIf you need any more help with this, feel free to hop on over to my free Facebook community or get yourself on the waitlist for my exclusive community, Sales Mastery Society.

I never thought in a million years that I would ever feel this way, because when I first started to sell, I dreaded it. I hated it. I ran away from it. So if you're anything like me, you want to stay tuned because we're diving in deep about five key things that I believe that you need to have in place in order to make sure that your sales mindset game is on point.\nIn this episode, we're talking all about sales mindset and exactly what it is that you need in order to be able to win at this game of sales. Now, sales strategies are important. Don't get me wrong. But they're only really about 20% of your ultimate success. The other 80% probably even more than that is really all what goes on inside your head. It's inside your heart and inside of you.\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nSelling is not about lying. If you're trying to convince people, it typically means you don't believe in the product or service that you're trying to sell.\nI always like to take the shortcut. I always like to take the proven path from somebody else that has already walked the path ahead of me.\nWhen we do the right thing by the people that we're serving, we actually end up winning even more. And in order to do that, sometimes you have to turn down a sale.\u00a0\n\nQuotables:\n\nReally understand what it is and what it takes for you to be confident in your own abilities to produce the results and transformation that you're promising to your customers.

Whether you're already good at sales or just starting, there are two big things you need to get really good at to make those sales happen. Let's talk about what these are and how they can help you sell more.\n\n##Know Who You're Selling To\n\nThe first big thing for good sales is really knowing your customer. You gotta understand who they are, what they want, and why they buy things. Here's how to do that:\n\n##Think Like Them\nTo understand your customer, you need to think like them. What problems do they have? What worries them? When you really get how they feel, you can offer them things that they'll care about.\n\n##Listen Well\nListening is super important in sales. When you listen carefully to your customers, you learn much about what they want and need. Ask them questions that make them think and pay attention to their answers. This helps you make your sales pitch just right for them.\n\n##Know Your Stuff\nLearn about the people you're selling to. What's popular right now? What are other businesses like yours doing? Knowing all this helps you make your product or service just right for your customers.\n\n##Make Them Trust You\nThe second big thing is making your customers trust you. Trust is really important for selling stuff. Here's how to build it:\n\n##Be Real\nPeople can tell if you're not being real. Be yourself when you talk to customers. Show them you really want to help solve their problems, not just sell something. Being real makes people trust you.\n\n##Help Them Out\nTry to help your customers, not just sell to them quickly. When you offer things that really help them, they'll trust you more and see you as someone who's there to help, not just sell.\n\n##Do What You Say\nIf you say you'll do something, like follow up with more info or help with a problem, make sure you do it. When you're reliable, people trust you more.\n\n##Wrapping Up\nSo, selling well is all about knowing your customer and making them trust you. Get better at understanding people, listening, and knowing your market. Also, be real, helpful, and do what you say you'll do. You'll see your sales go up and make more happy customers. Now go out there and sell like a pro!\n\nWhat are you doing to understand your customers and build trust? Let us know in the comments!",

struggling to sell, perhaps you're over complicating things. I know that it happens for a lot of my clients. You're making things harder than they need to be.\n\nIn today's episode, I\u2019m breaking down super simply, the two critical pieces that you actually need to have in place regardless of whether you're selling a product or service.\n\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\n \tIt really doesn't matter what you're selling. You need something to sell and you need somebody to buy it and that's it.\n \tYou can't simply just build it and hope that they will come. Because even if you have a buyer, if you are not clear, they are not going to buy just simply because you've made the offer or you have it available.\n \tYou need to have the offer, but you also need to make sure that your messaging, your marketing, your positioning, how you've described it or you're explaining that in your communication really makes sense for your buyer.\n\nQuotables:\n\n \tDon't go for clever. Go for clear. Because if you are clear, it's much easier for people to know what they're buying. [Tweet This]\n \tWhen it comes to your offer, it's about the transformation. It\u2019s about what is the end result and what is the benefit of the benefit. [Tweet This]\n \tDo you have enough buyers such that your metrics will provide the results that you need to see in your business? [Tweet This]\n\nHighlights:\n\n \tThe TWO critical pieces you need in order to sell [02:23]\n \tThe most important thing you need to keep in mind when you are creating your offer [05:11]\n \tHow to communicate the transformation, the end result of what you\u2019re selling to your buyers [07:02]\n \tHow to identify which of the two critical pieces you are missing right now [09:00]\n \tHow I started making sales after tweaked my offer based on what my community wanted [12:25]\n \tHow to do an audit of your current offer and how to tweak it to get more sales [15:25]\n\nSend me your burning questions:\n\nSend me your questions and I will profile you here on an upcoming show.\n\nFind out more about me here:\u00a0\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/SusanMcVea\n\nFacebook Group:  www.facebook.com/groups/successfulsalesstrategies\u00a0\n\nInstagram: @susanmcvea\n\nWebsite: www.susanmcvea.com\n\n[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=\"4_4\"][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section bb_built=\"1\" _builder_version=\"3.23.3\" background_color=\"#0a1e39\" prev_background_color=\"#ffffff\"][et_pb_row _builder_version=\"3.23.3\" module_alignment=\"center\"][et_pb_column type=\"1_2\"][et_pb_text _builder_version=\"3.23.3\" text_font=\"||||||||\" text_text_color=\"#FFFFFF\" text_font_size=\"20px\" custom_padding=\"|||10px\"]\n\nDo you have a question for Susan?\nSubmit your question and get featured on the podcast!\nClick the button below for instructions.\n\n[/et_pb_text][et_pb_button button_url=\"https://staging17.podcast.susanmcvea.com/ask/\" url_new_window=\"on\" button_text=\"HIT THAT RECORD BUTTON\" button_alignment=\"left\" _builder_version=\"3.23.3\" custom_button=\"on\" button_text_color=\"#e1be64\" button_font=\"||||||||\" custom_margin=\"30px|||10px\" custom_padding=\"|||\" /][/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=\"1_2\"][et_pb_image src=\"https://staging17.podcast.susanmcvea.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ASK-RACHEL-1.png\" url=\"https://staging17.podcast.susanmcvea.com/ask/\" url_new_window=\"on\" _builder_version=\"3.23.3\" width=\"78%\" module_alignment=\"left\" custom_margin=\"-40px||\" /][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]",

        "human_post": "##Lead Generation: It's Really About Sales\n\nStruggling to get leads? Feel like no matter what you do, they just aren't coming in? You're not the only one. A lot of businesses have this problem. And here's a little secret: often, the trouble with getting leads is more about sales than marketing. Let's dive into why that is.\n\n##When Marketing and Sales Don't Talk\n\n**Different Goals**\n\nA big reason why getting leads is tough is because marketing and sales teams don't always work together. Marketing tries to get leads, and sales tries to close deals. If they don't talk to each other, things get mixed up, and leads get lost.\n\n##Leads That Don't Fit\n\nMarketing can bring in lots of leads, but if they're not the right kind, they're not much use to sales. It's important for both teams to agree on what makes a good customer. This way, marketing brings in leads that sales can really use.\n\n##Slow Follow-up\n\nSometimes, marketing does pass good leads to sales, but then nothing happens fast enough. If you don't reach out to a lead quickly, they might lose interest. This is where sales need to step up and make quick moves.\n\n##How to Fix It: Get Marketing and Sales on the Same Page\n**Shared Goals**\n\nTo fix the lead problem, marketing and sales need to have the same goals. When both teams know what they're working towards, they understand each other better and can work together more effectively.\n\n**Talk to Each Other**\n\nIt's really important for marketing and sales to talk to each other. Regular meetings can help both sides understand what kind of leads are coming in and what the sales team needs.\n\n**Score and Nurture Leads**\n\nUsing a system to score leads helps sales know which ones to focus on. Marketing can also help by keeping leads interested until they're ready to buy.\n\nThe Personal Touch in Getting Leads\nKnow What Your Customers Need\n\nTo get good leads, you need to really understand what your customers are looking for. What problems do they have? What do they need help with? If you can answer these questions, your lead efforts will be more successful.\n\n**Build Real Relationships**\n\nPeople buy from people they like and trust. So, it's important to build real relationships with your leads. Show them you care about their problems, not just about selling something. When leads feel valued, they're more likely to become customers.\n\n##Finalizing\nGetting leads isn't just about collecting contact info. It's about understanding your customers, guiding them, and helping them with their problems. By getting marketing and sales to work together, focusing on the right leads, and adding a personal touch, you can turn lead generation from a problem into a success.\n\nRemember, it's not just about making a sale. It's about building a relationship that's good for both you and your customer. Let's work together to fix the lead generation problem and help your business grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This episode will be perfect as we\u2019re going to dive in deep in to the three biggest reasons why your high-ticket sales aren't going to happen.\nIn this episode, we\u2019re talking about why lead generation is a huge part of your sales process and how important it is when you're trying to get more sales, help more customers and make more money and impact.\nSometimes we overthink and get so caught up in our own stories that we miss sight of the fact that fundamentally, regardless of what we're selling, whether it's a product or service, but especially the higher the ticket price, the more that's on the line, not just for you, but ultimately for your potential customers.\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nIf you're talking to customers that you really, really do want to work with and yet they still keep saying no, there's still that's keeping them on the fence or you're getting frustrated.\nIdentify if there\u2019s something about your offer that has been poorly explained that needs more communication, more explanation or clarification in order to make sure that it really does meet the needs of your ideal customer.\nThe more you can empathize with your potential customers, the more you can set their minds at ease. You can use past customer successes and testimonials, as well as examples from your own life and from the people around you, to let them know that they are not alone.\n\nQuotables:\n\nIt\u2019s all about you and your authority.

It's really annoying when you work hard but can't seal the deal. Don't worry, though. I'm here to talk about three things that might be getting in your way when you're trying to make those big sales. Let's figure out what's stopping you.\n\n##1. Not Feeling Confident Enough\n###Feeling Like a Fake\nDo you sometimes feel like you're not as good as the people you're trying to sell to? That little voice telling you you're not good enough? That's you doubting yourself. Remember, you're a pro with lots of skills and knowledge. Be proud of what you've done and stop doubting yourself.\n\n##Scared of Being Turned Down\nBeing scared of getting a \"no\" can really hold you back, especially with big sales. But remember, being turned down is just part of selling. It's not about you personally. Instead of being scared of \"no,\" think of it as a chance to learn. Each \"no\" gets you closer to a \"yes.\"\n\n##2. Not Showing the Value Right\n###Not Seeing Their Problems\nTo sell something, you need to know what problems your customer has. If you don't show how your product or service can fix their specific problems, you're missing out. Really listen to your customers and make sure your product fits their needs.\n\n###Not Standing Out\nIn a world with lots of competition, you need to be different. If your sales pitch doesn't show why you're better than others, it's hard to make big sales. Show what makes you special and why your product is the best choice. It's not just about what you're selling, but why you're the best person to buy from.\n\n##3. Not Building Relationships Well\n###Hurrying Too Much\nGood relationships take time to build. If you try to rush and close the deal too fast, it won't work. Spend time getting to know your customers. Show that you really care about their business and want to help them succeed.\n\n###Forgetting to Follow Up\nJust talking once usually isn't enough, especially for big sales. If you don't keep in touch after your first talk, you might miss out on a sale. Keep talking to your customers after you first meet them. Being persistent and following up shows you're serious and helps build trust.\n\n##In Conclusion\nMaking big sales is tough, but if you work on these three things, you can get better at it. Believe in yourself, show how valuable your product is, and take time to build strong relationships. Keep trying, be understanding, and be ready to change your approach, and you'll start making those big sales. You can do it!\n\nSo, those are the three big things that might be stopping you from making those big sales. Start using these tips now, and you'll see how your sales skills grow. Good luck, and here's to your success!",

So that you can ultimately get more comfortable with your sales conversations.\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nPreparation is very much a critical piece of your overall success. However, there's such a thing as being prepared and then waiting for an objection to happen.

Respond accordingly because more than likely the information that's being shared is something that you didn't even know you didn't even uncover earlier on in the conversation because you didn't ask the right questions.\n\nQuotables:\n\nThe no actually becomes no because you have made it so. You have ultimate control and power over whether or not the conversation is going to continue. [Tweet This]\nSales is leadership. Be a leader. Allow them to understand the choices that they're making and empowering them with.

        "human_post": "# How To Overcome The Biggest Objections When Selling \ud83e\udd14\n\nSelling is tough. We get it. Whether you're selling a product, a service, or an idea, you've probably encountered your fair share of objections. It's frustrating when you know your offering could truly benefit someone, yet they still hesitate. But fear not, as there are ways to overcome these objections and close the deal. In this post, we'll cover some of the biggest objections when selling and how to tackle them head-on. \n\n## Understanding the Objections\n\nBefore diving into specific strategies, it's essential to understand why objections arise in the first place. People object to a sale for various reasons, including:\n\n### Lack of Trust\n\nCustomers may doubt the quality of your product or service or have concerns about your company's reputation.\n\n### Budget Constraints\n\nMany objections stem from the perceived high cost of the offering. Prospects may be worried about getting enough value for the price.\n\n### Misunderstanding\n\nSometimes, objections arise due to a lack of clarity or misunderstanding about what you're selling.\n\n## Tips for Overcoming Objections\n\nNow that we've pinpointed the common reasons for objections, let's delve into some effective strategies for overcoming them.\n\n### Build Trust\n\n#### Testimonials and Case Studies\n\nProvide evidence of your product or service delivering results for others. Testimonials and case studies can aid prospects to see the real value you offer.\n\n#### Guarantee Satisfaction\n\nOffer a money-back guarantee or a free trial. This shows confidence in what you're selling and reduces the risk for the customer.\n\n### Address Budget Concerns\n\n#### Emphasize Value\n\nHighlight the long-term benefits and return on investment that your offering provides. When prospects understand the value, they're more likely to see the price as an investment and not an expense.\n\n#### Offer Flexible Payment Options\n\nTo ease budget constraints, consider offering payment plans or financing options. This makes your offering more accessible to a wider range of customers.\n\n### Clarify Misunderstandings\n\n#### Active Listening\n\nTake the time to truly understand your prospect's concerns. Ask open-ended questions to uncover their objections and address them directly.\n\n#### Provide Detailed Information\n\nOffer clear and transparent information about your product or service. Including how it works, what problems it solves, and how it compares to alternatives.\n\n## Handling Common Objections\n\nNow, let's tackle some of the most common objections head-on and explore how to respond effectively.\n\n### \"It's too expensive.\"\n\n#### Response\n\n\"I understand that price is a concern. Let me walk you through the long-term benefits and how our offering can save you money in the grand scheme of things.\"\n\n### \"I need to think about it.\"\n\n#### Response\n\n\"Absolutely, take all the time you need. In the meantime, is there anything specific that's causing hesitation?\"\n\n### \"I've had a bad experience with something similar before.\"\n\n#### Response\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that. We've worked hard to ensure our offering addresses the shortcomings of others. Can I share how we've improved upon those issues?\"\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nObjections are a natural part of the sales process, and learning how to overcome them is a crucial skill for any sales professional. By understanding the root causes of objections, building trust, addressing budget concerns, and clarifying misunderstandings, you can effectively navigate objections and guide prospects towards making a confident purchasing decision.\n\nRemember, objections aren't roadblocks; they're opportunities to demonstrate the value of what you're selling. Practice empathetic listening, offer solutions, and remain confident in the worth of your offering. With these strategies in your toolkit, you'll be better equipped to overcome objections and close more deals. Keep at it, and success will follow!",

        "human_post": "# Top 3 Sales Trends For 2020 To Increase Your Revenue\n\nAre you looking to boost your sales and revenue in 2020? The world of sales is constantly evolving, and staying ahead of the curve is crucial for success. In this blog post, we'll discuss the top 3 sales trends for 2020 that can help you supercharge your sales efforts and drive more revenue for your business. Let's dive in! \n\n## 1. Personalization is Key\n\n### The Power of Data\nIn 2020, personalization will be more important than ever. Customers are craving a more personalized experience, and leveraging data is the key to achieving this. By harnessing the power of data analytics, you can gain valuable insights into your customers' behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns. This data can then be used to tailor your sales and marketing efforts to each individual customer, creating a more personalized and engaging experience.\n\n### Customer-Centric Selling\nInstead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, focus on understanding each customer's unique needs and pain points. This customer-centric approach shows that you care about their individual requirements, which can lead to stronger relationships and increased sales. Whether it's through personalized email campaigns, targeted product recommendations, or customized sales pitches, personalization will be a game-changer for driving revenue in 2020.\n\n## 2. Embracing Technology\n\n### Automation and AI\nTechnology continues to revolutionize the sales industry, and in 2020, embracing automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will be essential for maximizing efficiency and productivity. Automation tools can streamline repetitive tasks, freeing up your sales team to focus on building relationships and closing deals. AI-powered analytics can give valuable insights into customer behavior, allowing for more strategic and targeted sales approaches.\n\n### Virtual Selling\nWith the rise of remote work and virtual meetings, sales teams are increasingly turning to virtual selling techniques. Video conferencing, virtual product demos, and online presentations are becoming the new norm. Embracing these virtual selling strategies can help you reach a wider audience, reduce travel costs, and adapt to the changing business landscape.\n\n## 3. Building Trust Through Transparency\n\n### Authenticity in Sales\nIn an age of information overload and skepticism, building trust with customers is more important than ever. Transparency and authenticity are the building blocks of trust, and sales teams that prioritize honesty and openness will have a competitive edge. Be transparent about your products or services, pricing, and business practices. Provide genuine value and solutions that align with your customers' best interests.\n\n### Relationship Selling\nFocus on building long-term, genuine relationships with your customers instead of pursuing quick wins. By prioritizing trust and transparency, you can create loyal customers who are more likely to repeat purchases and advocate for your brand. Relationship selling fosters a sense of partnership and mutual success, laying the foundation for sustainable revenue growth.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nAs we embrace the new decade, it's critical to adapt to the evolving sales landscape. By prioritizing personalization, leveraging technology, and fostering trust and transparency, you can position your business for success in 2020 and beyond. These sales trends are not just about increasing revenue; they're about creating meaningful connections and delivering exceptional value to your customers. So, embrace these trends, stay agile, and get ready to elevate your sales game to new heights this year!\n\nWith these strategies in place, you'll be well-equipped to navigate the ever-changing sales landscape and drive impressive results for your business. Here's to a successful and prosperous 2020!",

It\u2019s the wrong question that you\u2019ve been asking. You need to be asking two other more critical questions first before we can even get to that next question, which is still important, but you're asking in the wrong order.In this episode, we\u2019re diving deep into the single most important question that you are simply not asking about your potential customers time and time again. Let\u2019s start asking the right questions so you\u2019ll know exactly where to find them, what to offer them and why they\u2019d want to work with you. And that makes it a lot easier!Biggest Takeaways:Business owners and entrepreneurs struggle to get consistent leads simply because they are not clear on who are their ideal client and what is the problem that they solve.You need the clarity of being able to understand WHO are your ideal clients, because if you don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t matter where you look for them, you simply aren\u2019t going to find them.Get laser focused on who you want to help with such specificity that you could point them out across a crowded room and know exactly that that is your person.

Let's talk about something crucial today - understanding your clients. Sure, you may think you know your clients inside and out, but are you asking the right questions to really get to the core of who they are and what they need? Let's dive into the most important questions about your clients that you might not be asking yet.\n\n## The Why Behind Their Actions\n\nUnderstanding the motivations and reasons driving your clients is essential. By asking the following questions, you can gain a deeper understanding of what drives them:\n\n### What are their main goals and aspirations?\n\nDo they have short-term or long-term goals? What are their aspirations for the future, both personally and professionally? Understanding what drives them can help you tailor your products or services to align with their ambitions.\n\n### What are their pain points and challenges?\n\nWhat keeps them up at night? What are the biggest challenges they face in their daily lives or within their business? By understanding their pain points, you can position yourself as the solution they've been searching for.\n\n## Their Preferred Communication Style\n\nCommunication is key in any relationship, including the one you have with your clients. By understanding their preferred communication style, you can ensure that your interactions are productive and positive.\n\n### How do they prefer to be contacted?\n\nDo they like emails, phone calls, or face-to-face meetings? Understanding their communication preferences can help you streamline your interactions with them and avoid any potential miscommunications.\n\n### What tone or language resonates with them?\n\nDo they prefer a formal and professional tone, or do they respond better to a more casual and friendly approach? Understanding the tone and language that resonates with your clients can help you tailor your communication to better connect with them.\n\n## Their Decision-Making Process\n\nUnderstanding how your clients make decisions can provide valuable insight into how to approach them and present your products or services in a compelling way.\n\n### What factors influence their decision-making?\n\nDo they prioritize cost, quality, or convenience? Understanding the factors that hold the most weight in their decision-making process can help you tailor your offerings to meet their specific needs.\n\n### Who else is involved in the decision-making process?\n\nAre there other key decision-makers or influencers in the picture? Understanding who else plays a role in the decision-making process can help you navigate any potential obstacles and ensure that all stakeholders are taken into consideration.\n\n## Their Feedback and Satisfaction\n\nLastly, asking for feedback and understanding their level of satisfaction can help you continually improve and adjust your offerings to better suit their needs.\n\n### How do they prefer to provide feedback?\nDo they feel more comfortable providing feedback in person, through surveys, or via email? Understanding their preferred feedback method can encourage them to share their thoughts more openly.\n\n### What would make them a raving fan of your business?\nUnderstanding what would turn them into your biggest advocate can help you focus on delivering exceptional experiences that exceed their expectations.\n\nTo conclude, understanding your clients goes beyond surface-level information. By asking the right questions, you can gain valuable insights that allow you to tailor your products and services to better meet their needs. So, go ahead, start asking these important questions and get ready to forge deeper, more meaningful connections with your clients. Your business will thank you for it!\n\nRemember, the key is to be genuinely curious and empathetic towards your clients. The more you understand them, the better equipped you'll be to serve them effectively.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

Maybe you\u2019re like me and you might be tempted to completely turn off this episode because you really don't like the idea of having to network at all. Especially if you're an introvert and your insides are already cringing a little bit. But I\u2019m going to ask that you give this episode a chance no matter what your personality, what your experience has been with other networking events or just the whole idea of it.In this episode, We're going to be talking all about networking and how to do it like a pro using tools that are right at your fingertips, on your phone and how to do it without being sleazy or spammy. I don\u2019t want you to miss the boat! I want you to take advantage of a huge opportunity that I believe is still available to you.Biggest Takeaways:No matter what social media platform you choose to network on, you don't need to be anybody other than yourself.If you are networking for the sole purpose of selling somebody right there on the spot, that is never going to work or very rarely is that going to work. Because people buy from those that they know, like, and trust. While we could speed that up with some borrowed relationship, you can't rush it.If you've been genuine and curious, then almost automatically you're going to create a connection with somebody. This is the perfect spot in order to lay the foundation for a relationship, whether that's short term or long term.If you are really good at what you do, then you should never feel afraid about sharing what you do and why you're so passionate about helping them. When you allow them the opportunity to open up and see the gift that's inside of you, the way that you can help them and the offer you are providing to them is going to change their lives.Quotables:Networking is a big part of your business model, but it shouldn't be the only reason why you're networking. You need to be intentional, be human and personable. [Tweet This]The number one topic that business owners love to talk about is themselves. By virtue of you being curious and asking a lot of questions, they are naturally going to open up to you. #salesconversations #salesstrategy\u00a0[Tweet This]Really think about how you\u2019d like to network. Don't veer off course simply because an expert has told you that this is the best way to be social. Do what works for you and feels good to you.

        "human_post": "# How to Network Online Using Social Media Without Being Spammy\n\nAre you looking to expand your professional network but don't want to come off as pushy or spammy? Networking on social media can be a great tool for growing your career or business, but it's key to do it in a way that is genuine and respectful. In this blog post, we'll explore some tips and strategies for networking online without being spammy.\n\n## Understanding the Importance of Genuine Connections\n\n### Building Authentic Relationships\nOne of the keys to effective online networking is to focus on building authentic relationships. Instead of approaching people with the sole intention of getting something from them, aim to connect on a deeper level. This means taking the time to understand their interests, values, and professional goals.\n\n### Providing Value\nNetworking is a two-way street. Instead of just asking for favors or promotions, find ways to provide value to your connections. Share helpful articles, offer advice, or congratulate them on their achievements. By giving before you ask, you'll be seen as a valuable and trusted connection.\n\n## Choosing the Right Platforms\n\n### Identifying Your Target Audience\nNot all social media platforms are created equal when it comes to networking. Identify where your target audience spends their time online, whether it's LinkedIn for professionals, Twitter for industry news, or Instagram for visual branding. Tailor your approach to the platform where you are most likely to make meaningful connections.\n\n### Engaging in Relevant Conversations\nOnce you've identified the right platforms, start engaging in conversations that align with your professional interests. Share your insights, comment on others' posts, and participate in industry-related discussions. This will help you get noticed by like-minded individuals and establish yourself as a valuable contributor to the community.\n\n## Cultivating a Thoughtful Networking Strategy\n\n### Personalizing Your Outreach\nWhen reaching out to potential connections, take the time to personalize your messages. Avoid generic, templated requests, and instead mention specific reasons why you admire their work or would like to connect. Showing that you've done your homework and are genuinely interested in them goes a long way.\n\n### Being Patient and Persistent\nBuilding a network takes time, and not every connection will yield immediate results. Be patient and persistent in your outreach efforts, but always respect others' boundaries and priorities. Follow up with a friendly reminder if you haven't heard back, but don't be pushy or aggressive.\n\n## Nurturing and Maintaining Relationships\n\n### Following Up and Following Through\nOnce you've made initial connections, it's important to follow up and follow through on any promises or commitments you've made. Send a thank-you note after a helpful conversation, offer to connect them with someone in your network, or share resources that align with their interests. These small gestures can go a long way in solidifying your relationships.\n\n### Staying Genuine and Authentic\nAs you continue to nurture your connections, it's crucial to remain genuine and authentic in your interactions. Avoid coming across as transactional or overly self-promotional. Instead, continue to provide value, support others, and celebrate their successes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNetworking online can be a powerful tool for professional growth, but it's crucial to approach it with authenticity and respect. By focusing on building genuine relationships, choosing the right platforms, cultivating a thoughtful strategy, and nurturing your connections, you can network online effectively without being spammy. Remember, it's not just about what you can get from your network, but what you can give in return. Happy networking!",

        "human_post": "# 7 Ways You Might Be Sabotaging Your Sales Success\n\nAre you struggling to close deals and meet your sales targets? It could be that you are unknowingly sabotaging your own success. In the fast-paced world of sales, it's easy to fall into bad habits that hinder your performance. Let's take a look at 7 common ways you might be getting in your own way when it comes to sales success\u203c\ufe0f\n\n## 1. Lack of Confidence\n\n### Subtopic: Negative Self-Talk\nSelf-doubt and negative self-talk can be major barriers to success in sales. If you always tell yourself that you're not good enough or that you'll never close the deal, you're setting yourself up for failure. Building confidence and maintaining a positive mindset is crucial for sales success.\n\n## 2. Not Understanding Your Customer\n\n### Subtopic: Failure to Listen\nOne of the biggest mistakes in sales is not taking the time to truly understand your customer's needs. If you're too focused on pushing your product or service without listening to what the customer actually wants, you're likely to miss out on valuable opportunities.\n\n## 3. Inadequate Product Knowledge\n\n### Subtopic: Lack of Preparation\nIf you don't have a deep understanding of what you're selling, you're setting yourself up for failure. Customers can easily spot a salesperson who doesn't know their product inside and out, which erodes trust and credibility.\n\n## 4. Fear of Rejection\n\n### Subtopic: Avoiding Follow-Ups\nFear of rejection is common in sales, but letting it dictate your actions can be detrimental. If you're avoiding follow-ups or not reaching out to potential leads because you're scared of being turned down, you're limiting your own success.\n\n## 5. Lack of Goal Setting\n\n### Subtopic: Not Having a Clear Plan\nWithout clear goals and a solid plan to achieve them, you're essentially navigating the sales process blindly. Setting clear, achievable goals and outlining the steps to reach them is crucial for success.\n\n## 6. Ineffective Time Management\n\n### Subtopic: Procrastination\nProcrastination can be a major obstacle to sales success. Wasting time on unimportant tasks or putting off important activities can hinder your productivity and impact your sales performance.\n\n## 7. Resistance to Adapt\n\n### Refusing to Learn\nThe sales landscape is constantly evolving, and those who refuse to adapt will be left behind. If you're not open to learning new techniques, embracing technology, and refining your approach, you could be sabotaging your own success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the world of sales, success is often determined by your ability to overcome obstacles and persevere in the face of challenges. By recognizing and addressing these common ways that you might be sabotaging your own success, you can take proactive steps towards improving your sales performance. Remember, it's never too late to course-correct and set yourself on the path to success. Embrace a positive mindset, prioritize understanding your customers, and continuously seek opportunities for self-improvement. Your sales success is within your control, and by addressing these challenges, you can unlock your full potential!",

When potential customers see real-life examples of others who have benefited from your product or service, it builds credibility and alleviates any doubts they may have. Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews and share their success stories.\n\n## 5. Transparency and Integrity \n\nBeing transparent in your business builds credibility and trust. Be open about your processes, pricing, and what customers can expect. Transparency shows that you have nothing to hide and that you are confident in the value you provide.

        "human_post": "# The 3 Phases Of Your Customer's Buying Journey (What You Need To Know To Increase Sales)\n\nHey there, fellow entrepreneur! Whether you're just starting out or you've been in business for a while, understanding your customer's buying journey is crucial to increasing your sales. By recognizing the three key phases your customers go through, you'll be better equipped to meet their needs and guide them towards making a purchase. Let's dive into the essentials of each phase and how you can leverage this knowledge to boost your sales.\n\n## Phase 1\ufe0f\u20e3: Awareness\n\nThe first phase of the buying journey is when your potential customers become aware of a problem or a need that they have. During this phase, they may not be aware of your brand or the solutions you offer. Here's what you need to know to make the most of this phase:\n\n### Understanding Customer Pain Points\nTo capture your customer's attention, you need to identify the pain points or challenges they are facing. Conduct market research, engage with your target audience on social media, and gather insights to understand what issues they are seeking solutions for.\n\n### Creating Educational Content\nEquip your customers with valuable information by creating educational content that addresses their pain points. Blog posts, social media posts, videos, and infographics are all great ways to provide informative content that establishes your brand as a helpful resource.\n\n### Engaging in Social Listening\nUse social listening tools to monitor conversations and mentions relevant to your industry. By actively engaging in discussions and offering solutions, you can position your brand as a valuable resource and build trust with potential customers.\n\n## Phase 2\ufe0f\u20e3: Consideration\n\nOnce your potential customers are aware of their needs, they enter the consideration phase, where they evaluate different options and solutions. To guide them through this phase, here's what you need to focus on:\n\n### Showcasing Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP)\nStand out from the competition by clearly articulating what makes your product or service unique. Whether it's exceptional quality, innovative features, or outstanding customer support, emphasize how your offering provides value that others don't.\n\n### Providing Social Proof\nCustomer testimonials, case studies, and online reviews play a critical role in influencing purchasing decisions. Provide social proof to reassure potential customers that others have had positive experiences with your brand.\n\n### Offering Comparative Content\nCreate content that compares the different solutions available in the market and positions your offering as the most suitable choice. Comparative guides, feature comparison charts, and demo videos can help potential customers understand why your product or service is their best option.\n\n## Phase 3\ufe0f\u20e3: Decision\n\nIn the decision phase, your potential customers are ready to make a purchase. To ensure that they choose your brand, consider the following strategies:\n\n### Simplifying the Buying Process\nMake the purchasing process as seamless as possible. Clear and intuitive website navigation, easy checkout procedures, and multiple payment options can reduce friction and encourage customers to complete their purchase.\n\n### Leveraging Retargeting and Remarketing\nStay top of mind by using retargeting ads to reach potential customers who have previously visited your website or interacted with your brand. Remarketing emails can also be effective in nudging potential customers towards making a purchase.\n\n### Providing Exceptional Customer Support\nOutstanding customer support can be a deciding factor for many customers. Ensure that your team is equipped to provide prompt and helpful assistance, whether it's through live chat, email, or phone support.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding the three phases of your customer's buying journey is essential for optimizing your sales process. By aligning your marketing and sales strategies with each phase, you can effectively engage potential customers, guide them towards making informed purchasing decisions, and ultimately increase your sales. Keep the customer's needs at the forefront, and tailor your approach to provide value at every step of their journey.

Are you feeling frustrated because you\u2019ve been offering free calls to potential clients, but they just aren\u2019t converting into paying customers? Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone. Many business owners struggle with this exact same issue.\n\nThe good news is that there are simple shifts you can make to increase your conversion rates and start turning those free calls into profitable opportunities. Let\u2019s take a look at why you might be struggling and explore some actionable strategies to turn things around.\n\n## Lack of Clarity in Your Offer\n\n### Problem: Your potential clients are unclear about the value they will receive from your free calls.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to communicate the benefits of your free calls clearly. If your potential clients don\u2019t understand how the call will help them, they\u2019re less likely to take you up on the offer.\n\n### Strategy: Clearly outline the benefits of the free call in your marketing materials and conversations.\n\nHighlight the specific problems your free call can solve for your potential clients. Show them the transformation they can experience as a result of the call. When they see the value, they\u2019ll be much more motivated to book a session with you.\n\n## Ineffective Communication During the Call\n\n### Problem: You may be missing the mark during your free calls, causing potential clients to disengage or lose interest.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re spending too much time talking about yourself and not enough time understanding the potential client\u2019s needs. Or perhaps you\u2019re overwhelming them with too much information.\n\n### Strategy: Focus on active listening and asking the right questions.\n\nDuring the call, make it all about the potential client. Ask probing questions to uncover their pain points and goals. Then, tailor your message to show how your offerings directly address their needs. This personalized approach can significantly increase your chances of conversion.\n\n## Lack of Follow-Up\n\n### Problem: You\u2019ve been letting potential leads slip through the cracks by not following up adequately after the free call.\n\nIt\u2019s common for potential clients to need more time to consider their options after the initial call. If you don\u2019t follow up effectively, you may lose out on converting them into paying customers.\n\n### Strategy: Implement a structured follow-up process.\n\nSend a thoughtful follow-up email within 24 hours of the call, summarizing the key takeaways and outlining next steps. Consider scheduling a follow-up call to address any remaining questions or concerns. By staying engaged with potential clients, you demonstrate your commitment to their success and keep the door open for future collaboration.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you\u2019ve been struggling to convert your free calls into paying customers, don\u2019t despair. By addressing common pitfalls such as lack of clarity in your offer, ineffective communication during the call, and inadequate follow-up, you can turn the tide and start seeing better conversion rates.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s all about clearly communicating the value of your free calls, actively listening to potential clients\u2019 needs, and following up consistently. With these simple shifts, you can transform your free calls into powerful tools for attracting and retaining loyal customers.\n\nSo, go ahead and give these strategies a try. You\u2019ve got this! Before you know it, you\u2019ll be converting those free calls into a thriving customer base that\u2019s excited to work with you.\n\nReady to take your business to the next level?

number one tool that allowed me to get fully booked in my business and create a six-figure income in such a short amount of time and has continued to allow me to build a successful business of my own design. All because I show up on video for the people who I'm here to serve.\n\nVideo isn\u2019t new. And if you are hoping that I would be telling you it's okay, just simply ignore using video, this is not the episode for you. Perhaps, you're thinking \u201cI'm not going to be using video\u201d. However, even if you're introverted and you don't like seeing yourself on video, I'm going to tell you why it's so important and how you can do it without showing your face. In this episode, I also discuss how you can incorporate video into your sales process and marketing messages so you can build relationships with your potential customers.\n\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\n \tVideo allows you to connect deeper with your target audience. However, it's also really important that you understand who your target audience is. This is not just about creating a massive following or a lot of fans.\n \tBe intentional in using video for your business. How do you want to show up on video? What do you think video is going to help you accomplish in your business, in the relationships and in connecting with the people that you want to serve?\n \tIf you are selling higher end, higher priced services, it is extremely critical that you don't lose sight of the fact that you are a person. People resonate with you, when they connect with you, when they relate to who you are as a human being. That's what builds relationships.\n\nQuotables:\n\n \tPeople buy based on emotion and they justify it with logic. Meaning if they don't have an emotional connection to you, they're not going to buy.\u00a0[Tweet This]\n \tWhen you're able to use stories, you evoke emotion. That's how we buy, that's what we connect, that's what we built relationships.\u00a0[Tweet This]\n \tThe more you can be consistent in using video in an intentional way, the faster you're going to be able to build really important relationships in your business.

        "human_post": "# What's The Value Of Your Offer? (How To Price With Confidence)\n\nHi there, fellow entrepreneur! Are you struggling with pricing your products or services? You're not alone. Figuring out the right price for what you offer can be a challenging task. However, with the right mindset and approach, you can price your offerings with confidence and clarity. In this blog post, I'll share some valuable insights on how to determine the true value of your offer and price it accordingly.\n\n## Understanding Your Value\n\n### Know Your Worth\nBefore you can confidently price your offer, you need to understand the value it provides. \n- What problem does it solve for your customers? \n- How does it make their lives better? \nTake some time to reflect on the impact of your offering and the transformation it brings. Knowing your worth is the first step to pricing with confidence.\n\n### Identify Unique Selling Proposition\nWhat makes your offer stand out in the market? Whether it's exceptional quality, outstanding customer service, or innovative features, your unique selling proposition (USP) plays a significant role in determining the value of your offer. Highlighting your USP can justify a premium price and set you apart from competitors.\n\n## Setting the Right Price\n\n### Cost-Based Pricing\nCalculating the cost of producing your offer is a fundamental aspect of pricing. Consider all expenses, including materials, labor, and overhead costs. Once you have a clear understanding of your production costs, you can add a suitable profit margin to determine the selling price. However, it's key to not solely rely on cost-based pricing, as it may undervalue the true worth of your offer.\n\n### Value-Based Pricing\nInstead of focusing solely on production costs, consider the value your offer delivers to customers. How much are they willing to pay for the benefits and solutions it provides? By aligning the price with the perceived value, you can capture the true worth of your offer. This approach allows for a more flexible pricing strategy that reflects the impact on the customer's life or business.\n\n## Overcoming Pricing Challenges\n\n### Fear of Overpricing\nMany entrepreneurs struggle with the fear of overpricing their offer and turning away potential customers. However, it's crucial to recognize the value you provide and the investment you've made in creating a high-quality solution. Remember, customers who understand and appreciate the value will be willing to pay a premium price for a premium offering.\n\n### Handling Price Objections\nPrice objections are common in business, but they shouldn't undermine your confidence in your pricing strategy. Instead of immediately lowering your prices in response to objections, focus on communicating the value and benefits of your offer. By confidently addressing concerns and emphasizing the return on investment, you can justify your pricing and build trust with customers.\n\n## Confidently Communicating Value\n\n### Compelling Product Descriptions\nWhen presenting your offer to potential customers, compelling product descriptions can effectively convey its value. Clearly articulate how your offering addresses their needs, solves their problems, or enhances their experiences. Use persuasive language that resonates with your target audience and clearly demonstrates the benefits they will gain.\n\n### Transparent Pricing\nTransparency is key to building trust with customers. Clearly communicate the factors that contribute to the pricing of your offer, whether it's the high-quality materials used, the extensive research behind the product, or the exceptional expertise involved. When customers understand the rationale behind the pricing, they are more likely to perceive it as fair and justifiable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPricing your offer with confidence is a combination of understanding its value, setting the right price, and effectively communicating that value to your customers. By recognizing your worth, leveraging a value-based pricing approach, and confidently addressing pricing challenges, you can establish a pricing strategy that reflects the true value of your offer. Remember, the value you provide deserves to be recognized and rewarded. You've worked hard to create something special, and pricing it with confidence is a reflection of that. Go forth, set your prices boldly, and watch your business thrive!",

        "human_post_html": "<h1 class=\"h1-class\">What's The Value Of Your Offer? (How To Price With Confidence)</h1>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Hi there, fellow entrepreneur! Are you struggling with pricing your products or services? You're not alone. Figuring out the right price for what you offer can be a challenging task. However, with the right mindset and approach, you can price your offerings with confidence and clarity. In this blog post, I'll share some valuable insights on how to determine the true value of your offer and price it accordingly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Understanding Your Value</h2>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Know Your Worth</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Before you can confidently price your offer, you need to understand the value it provides. \n- What problem does it solve for your customers? \n- How does it make their lives better? \nTake some time to reflect on the impact of your offering and the transformation it brings. Knowing your worth is the first step to pricing with confidence.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Identify Unique Selling Proposition</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">What makes your offer stand out in the market? Whether it's exceptional quality, outstanding customer service, or innovative features, your unique selling proposition (USP) plays a significant role in determining the value of your offer. Highlighting your USP can justify a premium price and set you apart from competitors.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Setting the Right Price</h2>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Cost-Based Pricing</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Calculating the cost of producing your offer is a fundamental aspect of pricing. Consider all expenses, including materials, labor, and overhead costs. Once you have a clear understanding of your production costs, you can add a suitable profit margin to determine the selling price. However, it's key to not solely rely on cost-based pricing, as it may undervalue the true worth of your offer.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Value-Based Pricing</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Instead of focusing solely on production costs, consider the value your offer delivers to customers. How much are they willing to pay for the benefits and solutions it provides? By aligning the price with the perceived value, you can capture the true worth of your offer. This approach allows for a more flexible pricing strategy that reflects the impact on the customer's life or business.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Overcoming Pricing Challenges</h2>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Fear of Overpricing</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Many entrepreneurs struggle with the fear of overpricing their offer and turning away potential customers. However, it's crucial to recognize the value you provide and the investment you've made in creating a high-quality solution.

Especially as experts when we start to tell instead of sell or thinking that telling is selling. Here's the thing, it is not the same. If you're caught in the trap of telling your potential clients about the features and giving them a lot of information and you're wondering why aren't people saying yes.\nPerhaps, right now, you are thinking about having these conversations with your potential customers, yet at the end of the conversation they are not asking you how they can buy, how to work with you or what's the next step, chances are you are falling into the telling trap. Don't beat yourself up because it is something we all fall into. It is totally normal. In this episode, I\u2019m going to teach you how to avoid this trap and what you can do instead that is much, much more effective and genuine!\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nWe fall into this trap of telling because we are not confident, we want to prove ourselves and make sure that the potential client knows how much we know.\nWhen you start actively selling, the number one thing you need to do is to start asking the right questions.\nYou should be doing very, very little telling, very, very little talking. Your role is to ask questions that will enable your potential customers to do the telling to you.\n\nQuotables:\n\nThe old outdated way of telling as a way of selling is simply not going to work. You're not going to be able to read off a spec sheet and figure that your people are going to buy. [Tweet This]\nPeople are genuinely looking to connect with you. They want to be heard. They want to be understood. They want to know that they're not alone and that you are the expert to help them find the solution that they're seeking.\u00a0[Tweet This]\nYour prospects will sell themselves because when you ask the right questions, they will have a realization that they do really need your help in the moment of answering.\u00a0[Tweet This]\n\nHighlights:\n\nWhy it\u2019s totally normal for all of us to end up telling instead of selling [02:54]\nAsking the right questions will allow your customers to sell themselves [07:10]\nHow to demonstrate your skills, even when you are just starting out [08:47]\nHow to help your potential client move closer towards the end outcome so they are already sold by the time they come to you [13:24]\nWhy we often fall into the trap of telling and how to avoid it [15:49]\n\nBonus Resource:\nTurn \u201cI Can\u2019t Afford It.\u201d Into \u201cSign Me Up!\u201d \u2013 Overcome price objections to get more sales, more paying clients and turn those Nos into Yeses!

        "human_post": "# Why Telling In Your Sales Is The #1 Reason Why You Are Not Selling\n\nHey, fellow sales professionals! If you've been struggling to close those deals and wondering why your sales numbers are not where you want them to be, then you've come to the right place. Let's talk about why telling in your sales is the #1 reason why you are not selling.\n\n## The Problem with Telling\nWhen it comes to sales, many of us fall into the trap of simply telling our potential customers about our products or services, thinking that the more we talk, the more likely they are to buy. However, this approach often leads to poor results and leaves us scratching our heads wondering where we went wrong. Here's why telling in your sales is not effective:\n\n### Lack of Connection\nBy focusing solely on telling, we miss out on the opportunity to truly connect with our customers. Sales is all about building relationships, and when all we do is bombard our prospects with information, we fail to establish a meaningful connection. People buy from people they like and trust, not from someone who just talks at them.\n\n### Ignoring Their Needs\nWhen we're busy telling, we often overlook the needs and pain points of our potential customers. Effective selling is about addressing the challenges and desires of our prospects, and if we're too wrapped up in our sales pitch, we fail to understand what truly matters to them.\n\n### One Size Does Not Fit All\nAnother downside of telling in sales is that it assumes a one-size-fits-all approach. Every customer is unique, with different preferences and concerns. By simply telling them about our offerings without tailoring our pitch to their specific needs, we miss the opportunity to show them how our product or service can solve their particular problems.\n\n## The Solution: Listening and Asking\nNow that we've identified the problems with telling in sales, let's explore the solution. The key to successful selling lies in listening and asking the right questions. Here's why this approach is a game-changer:\n\n### Building Relationships\nWhen we take the time to truly listen to our customers and ask thoughtful questions, we create an environment where meaningful conversations can thrive. This paves the way for building genuine relationships based on trust and understanding.\n\n### Understanding Their Needs\nBy actively listening to what our prospects have to say and asking probing questions, we gain valuable insights into their needs and pain points. This allows us to position our offerings as the solution they've been searching for, rather than bombarding them with generic information.\n\n### Tailoring Your Pitch\nListening and asking questions enables us to tailor our sales pitch to each individual customer. This personalized approach demonstrates that we value their unique requirements and shows them exactly how our product or service can make a positive difference in their lives.\n\n## The Power of Storytelling\nIn place of telling, consider the power of storytelling in the sales process. Instead of bombarding your prospects with facts and figures, weave a compelling narrative that illustrates how your offerings have made a difference for others. Storytelling engages the emotional side of your prospects' brains, making your pitch more memorable and impactful.\n\n## In Conclusion\nSo, if you've been struggling to close those deals and feeling frustrated with your sales performance, take a step back and reassess your approach. Instead of telling, focus on listening, asking the right questions, and telling compelling stories. By making this shift, you'll find yourself building stronger connections with your prospects, understanding their needs on a deeper level, and ultimately closing more sales. Here's to your success in sales!\n\nRemember, selling is not about you\u2014it's about your customers and how you can help them. So, go out there and start listening, asking, and telling compelling stories. Your sales numbers will thank you for it!\n\nNow go out there and crush those sales!\n\nP.S.

If you've been in the game for a while, you've probably heard the phrase \"know, like, and trust\" thrown around a lot. But do you really understand what it means for your sales? Well, today, I'm here to break it down for you and show you just how powerful these three little words can be for your business.\n\n## Building the Foundation: Know\n\nThe first step in the \"know, like, and trust\" journey is getting your potential customers to **know** you. This is all about visibility and making sure that your target audience is aware of your existence. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Delivering Value\n\nCreate valuable content that your audience will find helpful. Whether it's through blog posts, social media updates, or videos, use your expertise to solve their problems and answer their questions.\n\n### Consistent Branding\n\nMake sure your brand is consistent across all platforms. From your website to your social media profiles, your audience should be able to recognize and remember your brand easily.\n\n### Networking and Engagement\n\nEngage with your audience and industry peers both online and offline. Building relationships and making connections can help you expand your reach and get more people to know about your business.\n\n## Creating Connection: Like\n\nOnce you've got people knowing about your business, the next step is to get them to **like** you. This is where you start to build a deeper connection with your audience and show them the human side of your brand.\n\n### Authentic Storytelling\n\nShare your brand's story and let your audience get to know the people behind the business. Authenticity can go a long way in building trust and likeability.\n\n### Personalized Interactions\n\nInteract with your audience on a personal level. Respond to comments, messages, and emails in a friendly and genuine manner. Show them that there are real people behind the brand who care about their customers.\n\n### Showcasing Personality\n\nInject some personality into your brand's communication. Whether it's through humor, empathy, or passion, let your brand's personality shine through in all your interactions.\n\n## Earning Confidence: Trust\n\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, is the **trust** factor. This is what ultimately leads to sales. When your audience knows and likes you, they're more likely to trust you and choose your products or services over others.\n\n### Social Proof\n\nDisplay testimonials, reviews, and case studies to show that others have had positive experiences with your business. This social proof can help alleviate any doubts your potential customers may have.\n\n### Consistent Delivery\n\nConsistently delivering high-quality products and services will help build trust over time. When your customers know they can rely on you, they'll be more likely to make repeat purchases and recommend you to others.\n\n### Transparency and Integrity\n\nBe open and honest in your business dealings. Transparency and integrity are key components of trust. When your audience knows they can trust you, they'll feel confident in doing business with you.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the end, the \"know, like, and trust\" factor is all about building a strong relationship with your audience. It's about showing them that you're not just another faceless business, but a brand they can relate to and trust. By focusing on these three aspects, you can create a loyal customer base that will support your business for years to come. So, go ahead and start implementing these strategies today, and watch as your sales soar!\n\nRemember, it's not just about selling a product or service; it's about making a genuine connection with your audience. When they know, like, and trust you, the sales will naturally follow!",

RedCircleToday we're talking all about the deal breaker in all sales, all kinds, all types, especially as it relates to high ticket expert based sales. If you're selling workshops, retreats, program services done for you, types of work, consulting, all of these are what we call high ticket. It's a higher price point, a bigger price tag attached.\u00a0This is not about sleazy tactics being pushy or trying to convince people to buy. This is about the golden rule and we're talking all about that on today's episode. It\u2019s going to be a juicy one. In this episode, I dive in a little bit deeper about what it takes in order to be able to move forward in the sales process without all of those sleazy tactics and how to prevent your sales from falling apart.Biggest Takeaways:Trust is the critical piece that is the deal breaker in all sales, especially for high ticket sales.It is important that you never lose sight of the fact that people have put their faith and trust, hopes and dreams in you, your services and products. You need to honor that relationship.Trust is reciprocal. If you don't trust your customer and they don't trust you, then both of you aren\u2019t able to move forward in a working relationship.Quotables:When you only look out for you, you have a very short lived business. When you only look out for your clients, you have a nonprofit or worse a hobby because you're always giving to your clients and never looking out for yourself.

        "human_post": "# The Dealbreaker In All Sales\n\nHello, sales superstars! Whether if you\u2019re a seasoned pro or just starting out in the world of sales, there\u2019s one thing that can make or break a deal every time: trust. Building trust with your potential customers is the ultimate dealbreaker in all sales. Without it, you might as well hang up your sales hat and call it a day. But fear not, my friends, because I\u2019m here to share some insights into how you can build trust with your customers and seal the deal every time.\n\n## Understanding the Importance of Trust\n\nLet\u2019s face it \u2013 nobody wants to be sold to by someone they don\u2019t trust. In the world of sales, trust is the currency that drives all successful transactions. When your customers trust you, they\u2019re more likely to buy from you, refer others to you, and come back for repeat business. It\u2019s the secret sauce that separates the top performers from the rest. \ud83e\udd2b\n\n## Being Authentic and Genuine\n\n### Building a Connection\nThe first step in building trust with your customers is to be authentic and genuine. People can spot a phony a mile away, and no one wants to do business with someone who\u2019s not being real. Take the time to connect with your customers on a personal level. Show genuine interest in their lives, their challenges, and their aspirations. When you take the time to build a real connection, you build trust.\n\n### Honesty is the Best Policy\nAnother key element of being authentic and genuine is being honest with your customers. It\u2019s tempting to exaggerate or stretch the truth to make a sale, but in the long run, honesty is always the best policy. If you\u2019re upfront with your customers and manage their expectations, they\u2019ll respect you for it and trust you more.\n\n## Providing Value and Solutions\n\n### Understanding Their Needs\nTo build trust with your customers, you need to show them that you truly understand their needs and challenges. Take the time to listen to them and ask the right questions to uncover their pain points. When you can demonstrate that you understand their needs, they\u2019ll trust that you have their best interests at heart.\n\n### Offering Solutions\nOnce you understand your customer\u2019s needs, it\u2019s time to offer them real solutions. Your product or service should genuinely solve their problems and improve their lives in some way. When you can provide true value to your customers, they\u2019ll see you as a trusted advisor rather than just another salesperson.\n\n## Consistency and Reliability \n\n### Following Through \nConsistency and reliability are also crucial in building trust. If you say you\u2019re going to do something, do it. Follow through on your promises, deliver on time, and be there for your customers when they need you. When you consistently show up and deliver, you build trust over time.\n\n### Establishing Long-Term Relationships\nBuilding trust with your customers isn\u2019t just about making a sale \u2013 it\u2019s about establishing long-term relationships. Show your customers that you\u2019re in it for the long haul by being reliable and consistent in your interactions. When they see that you\u2019re committed to their success, they\u2019ll be more likely to trust you and stay loyal to your brand.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo there you have it, my fellow sales enthusiasts \u2013 the dealbreaker in all sales is trust. By being authentic and genuine, providing value and solutions, and maintaining consistency and reliability, you can build trust with your customers and close the deal every time. Remember, trust is the foundation of all successful sales relationships, so make it your top priority in every interaction. Go out there, build that trust, and watch your sales soar!",

        "human_post": "# 7 Keys To Recession Proof Your Business\n\n---\n\nIn times of uncertainty, it's crucial to protect your business from economic downturns. While it's impossible to predict the future, there are steps you can take to recession-proof your business and emerge even stronger. Let's delve into 7 key strategies that can help you navigate through tough times and keep your business afloat.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Diversify Your Revenue Streams\n\nDuring a recession, traditional revenue streams may dry up. Diversifying your income sources can provide stability and flexibility. Consider expanding your product or service offerings, targeting new customer segments, or exploring alternative sales channels. By diversifying, you can better withstand economic fluctuations and mitigate risks.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Build and Maintain Cash Reserves\n\nHaving a healthy cash reserve is essential for weathering economic downturns. Aim to build up a financial cushion that can cover several months' worth of operating expenses. This buffer can provide a safety net during lean times and give you the breathing room needed to adapt your business strategies.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Focus on Customer Retention\n\nIn challenging economic times, customer loyalty becomes increasingly valuable. Nurture your existing customer base by offering exceptional service, personalized experiences, and loyalty incentives. Happy and loyal customers are more likely to continue supporting your business, even when their budgets are tightened, helping you sustain revenue streams.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Embrace Operational Efficiency\n\nStreamlining your business operations can lead to significant cost savings. Evaluate your processes and look for ways to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and optimize resource allocation. By doing so, you can trim unnecessary expenses and position your business to operate more leanly, thereby improving your bottom line.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Invest in Marketing and Innovation\n\nWhile it may be tempting to scale back on marketing and innovation during a recession, these areas are critical for long-term success. By staying visible in the market and continually innovating, you can capture new opportunities, stay ahead of the competition, and maintain relevance with your customers. Strategic investments in these areas can pay off in the long run.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Strengthen Your Team\n\nYour employees are invaluable assets, especially during tough economic times. Engage your team, provide clear communication, and foster a supportive work environment. Encourage collaboration, creativity, and a shared sense of purpose. By building a resilient and motivated team, you can navigate challenges more effectively and position your business for recovery.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Stay Agile and Adaptable\n\nFlexibility is key to surviving and thriving in a recession. Be open to adjusting your business strategies, seizing new opportunities, and rapidly responding to market changes. Stay informed about industry trends, monitor economic indicators, and be prepared to pivot when necessary. Being agile and adaptable can help you stay ahead of the curve and navigate uncertain times with confidence.\n\n---\n\nTo conclude, by implementing these 7 key strategies, you can recession-proof your business and enhance its resilience. While economic downturns can be daunting, they also present opportunities for innovation and growth. By taking proactive measures and staying agile, you can position your business to not only withstand recessions but also emerge stronger on the other side.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this journey. Countless businesses have successfully navigated challenging times, and with the right mindset and strategies, so can you. Now is the time to take action and future-proof your business. Stay resilient, stay focused, and stay confident. You've got this!",

Strategic investments in these areas can pay off in the long run.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">6.

Stay Agile and Adaptable</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Flexibility is key to surviving and thriving in a recession. Be open to adjusting your business strategies, seizing new opportunities, and rapidly responding to market changes. Stay informed about industry trends, monitor economic indicators, and be prepared to pivot when necessary. Being agile and adaptable can help you stay ahead of the curve and navigate uncertain times with confidence.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">To conclude, by implementing these 7 key strategies, you can recession-proof your business and enhance its resilience. While economic downturns can be daunting, they also present opportunities for innovation and growth. By taking proactive measures and staying agile, you can position your business to not only withstand recessions but also emerge stronger on the other side.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Remember, you're not alone in this journey. Countless businesses have successfully navigated challenging times, and with the right mindset and strategies, so can you. Now is the time to take action and future-proof your business.

RedCircleIf you listened to an earlier episode\u00a0where I discussed my sales trend predictions for 2020 and beyond, this is a great episode for you because it takes it to the next level to help you identify how do you keep growing those personal relationships, what does that look like, who should they be with and how do you ensure that you are focusing on the right types of activities for each type of person.Biggest Takeaways:Too often we overlook the opportunity to connect when we're having conversations with individuals, we simply think they're not important enough because they're not a potential client. By doing that, we're diminishing the value that they could bring to the table for us because we're desperately looking for clients.The three relationship currencies - clients, collaborators and connectors, are all important. Our collaborators and connectors can indirectly and directly lead us to more clients.In these relationship currencies, you are in charge of how much goes in and how much gets taken out. There needs to be kind of a reciprocal back and forth because you can't have too much going and not enough coming out or vice versa.Quotables:There is no shortage of clients out there in the world for you to be able to tap into.\u00a0[Tweet This]Your whole thing is to find as many people that you can serve every single day, at least one person.

Whether you're selling a product, a service, or even an idea, understanding the different types of relationship currencies can greatly impact your ability to close deals and win over clients. In this blog post, we'll explore the three essential types of relationship currencies you need to master in order to excel in sales.\n\n## 1. Trust\n\nTrust is the foundation of any successful relationship, and it's especially crucial in sales. Building trust with your clients and prospects is essential for winning their business. Without trust, it's nearly impossible to persuade someone to buy from you.\n\n### How to Build Trust:\n- Be Transparent: Honesty and openness go a long way in building trust. Be clear about what you can offer, and don't overpromise.\n- Show Consistency: Consistency in your actions and communication will reassure your clients that they can rely on you.\n- Deliver Results: Nothing builds trust more than delivering on your promises. Focus on providing value and exceeding expectations.\n\n## 2. Empathy\n\nEmpathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. In sales, being able to empathize with your clients and prospects can significantly improve your ability to connect with them on a deeper level.\n\n### How to Practice Empathy:\n- Listen Actively: Pay attention to your clients' needs and concerns, and show genuine interest in understanding their perspectives.\n- Put Yourself in Their Shoes: Try to see things from your clients' point of view. What are their challenges, goals, and aspirations?\n- Offer Solutions: Use your understanding of your clients' needs to offer personalized solutions that address their specific pain points.\n\n## 3. Collaboration\n\nSales is not just about convincing someone to buy from you; it's also about building mutually beneficial relationships. Collaboration is the key to creating lasting partnerships with your clients.\n\n### How to Foster Collaboration:\n- Communicate Clearly: Clearly define the shared objectives and be transparent about the roles and responsibilities of both parties.\n- Be Flexible: Show willingness to adapt and accommodate your clients' needs and preferences.\n- Celebrate Success Together: Acknowledge and celebrate your joint achievements to reinforce the spirit of collaboration.\n\nTo summarize, mastering the three types of relationship currencies \u2013 trust, empathy, and collaboration \u2013 is essential for winning at sales. By focusing on building trust, practicing empathy, and fostering collaboration, you'll be better equipped to connect with your clients, understand their needs, and ultimately close more deals. Remember, sales is not just about transactions; it's about creating meaningful and lasting connections with the people you serve. So go ahead, hone these relationship currencies, and watch your sales soar!",

RedCircleIn this episode, I speak to Ross Johnson, a 27 year old serial entrepreneur dedicated to teaching coaches and consultants how to grow their online businesses. His trajectory was anything but typical. He went from being a broke personal trainer to building $2 million businesses in just four years, one of which he was able to exit successfully.Now he's helped hundreds of people grow their online businesses through his mentorship programs, which has earned him mentions in a ton of publications including Forbes, inc and Entrepreneur.In today's episode, we talk about so many different things. Everything from his very moderate modest upbringing to oyster farming, selling drugs, how the Four Hour Work Week inspired him to start his online business and why in the first four years and nothing, absolutely nothing seemed to be working for him.The biggest thing he identified with me is using a script. Having a step-by-step template of exactly what to say and when, so that he could start growing confidence and trust in his own ability to know exactly what to say, when to say it, why he was saying it to potential customers so that he could hear yes, after yes, after yes, consistently!Biggest Takeaways:If you don't make the sale, improve the offer over and over again and see if you can make the sale. And then when people make the sale, ask them why they bought, why did they buy from you and not someone elsePeople would buy right in the DM on a $5,000 product. This goes to show that the better your branding and marketing is, the less push you have to be with sales.If you don't ask, you're being selfish if you don't make the offer because you can change somebody's life and it's up to you.Quotables:You just got to think about who you want to be and be open to change.You can't be attached to the outcome. You can intend on making the sale, but you have to have no attachment to the outcome. Once you have an attachment to the outcome, people can feel it and it's going to make it challenging for you to make sales.If your branding and marketing is super on point, the sales calls can be really easy.Highlights:How Ross tried to give away a service for free, had calls with 60 people, yet none of them took up the offer [09:00]How do you pivot in your business and navigate that transition [12:07]How to reposition and rebrand yourself, especially when you are representing yourself as a personal brand in your business [16:31]How to stop taking rejection and everything else in your business so personally and go easy on yourself [19:20]What to do when you\u2019re struggling with pricing and you\u2019re hearing more Nos than Yes\u2019es on your sales conversations [21:30]How your marketing and branding directly influence your sales results [26:33]Business is a marathon, not a sprint. Why you need to focus on the long-term [34:57]How to not sound desperate when things aren\u2019t working [37:01]How you can build authority, build relationships and tap on other communities without coming off as a sleaze [40:00]How Ross used a script and practiced it and became really good at handling objections [42:16]This is such a goood episode. Ross shared some key points with us today, including how using\u00a0 a script helped him master the sales game and get him consistently closing more deals and helping more clients.\u00a0If you\u2019re struggling to figure out what to say on your discovery calls, or maybe tired of hearing objections and looking for your own sales script of what to say when talking to potential clients, check out my Discovery Call Bundle -\u00a0 it\u2019s the exact formula me and my clients have used to create 80% or more conversion rates.

You're not alone. Many have been in your shoes, like Ross Johnson. I got to sit down with Ross and discuss his amazing journey. He went from broke to earning seven figures in just four years. His story is truly inspiring, and I'm excited to share it with you.\n\n## The Lowest Point: Struggling and Broke\nRoss Johnson's path to success was tough.

RedCircle\n\nIn this episode, I speak to my good friend and client, Ebony Williams, a personal trainer, certified holistic nutritionist and a thyroid disease coach. She\u2019s on a mission to help individuals. Specifically women learn how to live healthy, happy lives through food, fitness and fun. She also works as a supervisor at John Hopkins Medicine in the Company Information Systems, Education Department.\n\nWe talked about so many different pieces that are related to sales, including why she struggled to sell, even though she was a door to door salesman back in New York (which I didn\u2019t know about until this conversation!) and how she got serious about her business in a whole new, different way.\n\nEbony also shares about how she is currently making more sales, even now during times of crisis, why she needed to get so serious about selling and what happened so she could live that happy, healthy, joy-filled life for herself.\n\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\n \tThere are a lot of folks who are watching and doing everything behind the scenes to really pay attention to you. They're not the ones who comment or respond back to you. They're not always the ones that are liking your content or showing up or the most vocal. Are you consistent? Are you actually in integrity with what you do and you say and you are? That's really important for all of us to remember now as we do the work that we do and as we're selling.\n \tMy audience is the most valuable asset that I have. I asked some questions like, \u201cHey, what do you think about this? Is there something that you're struggling with?\u201d And they tell me. If I'm going to create something, I ask them first. There has been a lot of market research to see what they want and need. That\u2019s how I've developed all of my products and services.\n \tOne of the things that I needed to let go of was realizing that it wasn't about me. The more I put time and energy and thinking about that one person that I would serve, the easier it became, the more fun I started to have. When you turn your focus outward instead of inwards, things just shift and they just start to \u201chappen\u201d for you.\n\nHighlights:\n\n \tWhy Ebony took the leap to start her own business even when she still has her 9-5 job [01:51]\nHow she got serious about her business in a whole new, different way after realizing that her business was turning into an expensive hobby [07:07]\nWhy she made the decision to live happy, healthy, joy-filled life for herself when everything was falling apart [24:31]\nWhat happened when Ebony made the decision to learn how to sell [28:29]\nHow to set boundaries and recognize that your time is valuable [39:13]\nHow Ebony has sold and made money on every single thing that she has put out [45:10]\n\nBonus Resource:\n\nTop 5 Secrets To More YES\u2019es - Get the exact same secrets I\u2019ve only shared with my premium VIP 1:1 clients paying multiple 5 figures.

Communicate this as your unique selling proposition. This attracts an audience that values what you offer.\n\n### Tailor Your Messaging\n\nCraft messages that address your new audience's pain points and desires. Show how your offerings can improve their lives.\n\n## Utilize Effective Marketing Strategies\n\nUse marketing strategies to reach and engage your new audience.

am so excited to bring this episode to life for you because these are the critical business skills I believe that you need to have, especially during a bear market. We are in a bear market right now, meaning that the market is going down and we have been in a bull market, an arising and increasing market for almost the last 12 years since the end of the great recession that was caused by the financial crisis back in 2008. It's been a while since we've actually needed to use some of these critical skills or really think about what is going to help us to get through.In this episode, I\u2019ve identified and broken down the five critical business skills that will help any business owner in tough times and build longevity in your business. Bring your pen and notebook because there are many great questions that will help you get clear on and start practicing these critical business skills.Biggest Takeaways:Your entire sales process from what you say, how you say it, how you make them feel, the questions you're asking and your complete end to end client experience, could be the difference between people saying yes and no.When you are able to communicate your needs, your wants, your desires, all facets of your life, everything improves.Working for an organization with over 80,000 corporate global employees, when things got slow, we doubled down on education. We doubled down on investing in ourselves. We doubled down on skill build. Because when you get complacent and comfortable, you get into a groove of doing things one way without ever questioning if there's a better way to get better results with less effort and less time over the long term.Highlights:Why you need to learn to sell (especially if you\u2019re a business owner!) even if you are the reluctant salesperson [03:42]Sales and business is all about communication and why we focus on the quality of questions that you ask [11:38]How to make decisions faster and better as a business owner [14:29]Why building relationships is the most critical skill no matter where the economy swings [18:19]Why it\u2019s so important to know your numbers, your expenses, conversions, everything and how it helps you make better decisions [21:49]Bonus Resource:Top 5 Secrets To More YES\u2019es - Get the exact same secrets I\u2019ve only shared with my premium VIP 1:1 clients paying multiple 5 figures. Learn how to turn connections into conversations and conversations into a waitlist of dream clients.

        "human_post": "# The Key To Closing Deals Faster\n\nTired of slow deal closures? Frustrated with endless back and forth? Closing deals faster is achievable with the right tactics. This post will explore strategies to speed up your sales process and secure a \"yes\" quickly.\n\n## Understanding Your Prospect's Needs\n\nClosing deals quickly starts with understanding your prospect's needs. It's more than selling your product; it's about identifying their challenges. Tailor your pitch to address these pain points directly.\n\n### Active Listening\n\nActive listening is vital in sales. Focus on what your prospect says, not your next response. Ask questions and listen to the answers. This builds understanding, rapport, and trust.\n\n## Building Trust and Rapport\n\nTrust is essential in sales. Without trust, prospects are unlikely to commit. Prioritize building trust and rapport in your sales approach.\n\n### Authenticity\n\nBe genuine with prospects. Authenticity builds trust. People can tell when you're insincere, so always be authentic.\n\n### Establishing Authority\n\nShow your expertise in your field. Share insights and demonstrate knowledge. When you're seen as an authority, prospects are more likely to trust and agree to a deal.\n\n## Streamlining the Sales Process\n\nA complex sales process can slow down deal closures. Streamlining this process can encourage quicker decisions.\n\n### Clear and Concise Communication\n\nCommunicate clearly and concisely. Avoid overwhelming prospects with too much information. Focus on what matters most to them.\n\n### Remove Friction\n\nIdentify and eliminate friction points in your sales process. This could mean simplifying paperwork or clarifying pricing. Make the process as smooth as possible.\n\n## Overcoming Objections\n\nObjections are common, but handling them effectively is key to closing deals faster.\n\n### Anticipate and Address\n\nPredict potential objections and address them upfront. Resolving these issues early keeps the process moving smoothly.\n\n### Provide Social Proof\n\nUse testimonials or case studies as social proof. Seeing others' positive experiences can help prospects overcome their objections.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClosing deals faster is a realistic goal. Understand your prospects, build trust, streamline your process, and effectively handle objections. Remember, it's about solving your prospects' problems, not just making a sale. Master these strategies to become more efficient in closing deals.",

This post will explore strategies to speed up your sales process and secure a \"yes\" quickly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Understanding Your Prospect's Needs</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Closing deals quickly starts with understanding your prospect's needs. It's more than selling your product; it's about identifying their challenges. Tailor your pitch to address these pain points directly.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Active Listening</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Active listening is vital in sales. Focus on what your prospect says, not your next response. Ask questions and listen to the answers. This builds understanding, rapport, and trust.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Building Trust and Rapport</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Trust is essential in sales. Without trust, prospects are unlikely to commit. Prioritize building trust and rapport in your sales approach.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Authenticity</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Be genuine with prospects. Authenticity builds trust. People can tell when you're insincere, so always be authentic.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Establishing Authority</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Show your expertise in your field. Share insights and demonstrate knowledge. When you're seen as an authority, prospects are more likely to trust and agree to a deal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Streamlining the Sales Process</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">A complex sales process can slow down deal closures. Streamlining this process can encourage quicker decisions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Clear and Concise Communication</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Communicate clearly and concisely. Avoid overwhelming prospects with too much information. Focus on what matters most to them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Remove Friction</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Identify and eliminate friction points in your sales process. This could mean simplifying paperwork or clarifying pricing. Make the process as smooth as possible.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Overcoming Objections</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Objections are common, but handling them effectively is key to closing deals faster.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Anticipate and Address</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Predict potential objections and address them upfront. Resolving these issues early keeps the process moving smoothly.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Provide Social Proof</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Use testimonials or case studies as social proof. Seeing others' positive experiences can help prospects overcome their objections.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Closing deals faster is a realistic goal. Understand your prospects, build trust, streamline your process, and effectively handle objections. Remember, it's about solving your prospects' problems, not just making a sale. Master these strategies to become more efficient in closing deals.</p>\n",

If you've found your way to this post, chances are you're grappling with a big decision: whether to sell your business or hold onto it a little longer. It's a tough call, and one that many of us have faced at some point in our careers. Whether you're feeling the pressure of competing in a tough market, or you're simply ready to move on to new opportunities, deciding whether to sell or not to sell can be a daunting task. But fear not, because I'm here to help guide you through the process and make the best decision for your unique situation.\n\n## The Case for Selling\n### When To Consider Selling\nYou may want to consider selling your business if:\n- You've lost passion for your business\n- The market conditions have changed significantly\n- You've received a compelling offer\n- You're ready to move on to a new venture\n- You need a cash infusion for personal reasons\n\n### The Benefits of Selling\nSelling your business can offer a range of benefits, including:\n- Financial gain\n- Relief from the pressures of running a business\n- Opportunity to pursue new passions or interests\n- Cash for retirement or other personal goals\n- Potential for growth with a new owner\n\n## The Case for Holding On\n### When To Consider Holding On\nYou may want to consider holding onto your business if:\n- You still have a passion for what you do\n- The market is showing potential for growth\n- You have a solid plan for the future of your business\n- You're not ready to let go of the control and autonomy\n\n### The Benefits of Holding On\nKeeping your business can also bring about several advantages, such as:\n- Continuation of a fulfilling career\n- Potential for future financial gains\n- Legacy building and impact on your community\n- Maintaining control over the direction of your business\n\n## The Decision-Making Process\n### Assessing Your Priorities\nBefore making the decision to sell or hold onto your business, take the time to evaluate your priorities. Ask yourself:\n- What do I want to achieve by selling my business?\n- What do I stand to gain or lose by selling or holding on?\n- How does my decision align with my personal and professional goals?\n\n### Seeking Expert Advice\nDon't be afraid to reach out to professionals for guidance. Lawyers, accountants, financial advisors, and business brokers can provide valuable insights and help you weigh the pros and cons of selling or holding onto your business.\n\n### Consider the Emotional Impact\nIt's important to acknowledge the emotional impact of selling your business. Be mindful of how the decision may affect you personally and take the time to process your thoughts and feelings.\n\n## Making The Leap\n### Taking the Plunge\nOnce you've weighed your options, sought advice, and reflected on the emotional impact, it's time to make a decision. Trust your instincts and have confidence in the choice you make.\n\n### Embracing the Next Chapter\nWhether you decide to sell or hold onto your business, embrace the next chapter with optimism and excitement. Look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead and be proud of the journey you've taken.\n\n## Conclusion\nDeciding whether to sell or hold onto your business is a weighty decision that requires careful consideration. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, and what's right for one business owner may not be right for another. Remember that whatever you decide, it's essential to feel comfortable and confident in your choice. Seek advice, trust your instincts, and embrace the future with open arms. Good luck, and may your decision lead you to success and fulfillment!",

RedCircleMy good friend and client, Ebony Williams, inspired this episode. She asked, \u201cHow the heck do we sell with integrity? Can you talk a little bit more about this? I want to know how we can navigate and understand exactly how to sell with integrity, how to lead with integrity and how to make sure that we are doing right by our clients and our potential clients so that we are not leading them astray.\u201dAnd I thought, fabulous. This is a great topic. Especially right now when a lot of folks are worried that they may be seen as opportunistic when they sell. How do you still navigate the conversation and do it in a way that does not make you (and the other person) feel uncomfortable or like you\u2019re taking advantage of people.Biggest Takeaways:Money means opportunities and money means choices. But money is not the Holy Grail of why we do everything in our business.\u00a0If you are simply making decisions because you need the money, you will always need the money.The difference between being opportunistic and opportunity is inclusion and leadership. It's being able to say, I want you to be part of the win, not just about me as the business owner and me making money.Highlights:Why people will feel it If everything you do is focused solely on making monetary gains [02:28]How to stop the hamster wheel of always needing the money (Hint: boundaries) [04:47]Understanding what you do NOT want to do may be even more important than what you want to do [07:05]How do you sell in integrity and take advantage of opportunities without being opportunistic [08:26]Bonus Resource:Episode 43: To Sell Or Not To Sell? - Find out how you can decide to sell or not to sell in your business, how to sell in a way that is fun and easy and why your business requires you to sell!Top 5 Secrets To More YES\u2019es - Get the exact same secrets I\u2019ve only shared with my premium VIP 1:1 clients paying multiple 5 figures.

        "human_post": "# What Your Prospects Are REALLY Buying\n\nDo you ever find yourself wondering what your prospects are truly looking for when they consider purchasing a product or service? As a sales professional, it's essential to understand what drives your potential customers to make a buying decision. It's not just about the features and benefits of your offering - it's about fulfilling deeper emotional and practical needs. Let's take a closer look at what your prospects are REALLY buying.\n\n## The Solution to Their Problem\n\n### Understanding Pain Points\nWhen prospects are considering a purchase, they are looking for a solution to a problem or a need they have. It's crucial to identify their pain points and demonstrate how your product or service can alleviate their challenges. By understanding their specific issues, you can tailor your pitch to directly address what matters most to them.\n\n### Offering a Clear Solution\nYour prospects are buying a way to make their lives easier, more efficient, or more enjoyable. They want a resolution that is tangible and impactful. By highlighting how your offering directly addresses their pain points, you can show that you understand their needs and have a solution to offer.\n\n## Confidence and Trust\n\n### Establishing Credibility\nIn a crowded marketplace, prospects are seeking trust and confidence in the brands they choose to do business with. They want to know that they are making the right decision and that they can rely on you to deliver on your promises. Building credibility through testimonials, case studies, and transparent communication can reassure prospects that they are making a sound investment.\n\n### Personal Connection\nProspects are also buying into the relationship and personal connection they have with you as a sales professional. Building rapport and trust through authentic communication and a genuine interest in their needs can make a significant impact on their decision-making process.\n\n## Positive Emotions and Experience\n\n### Creating Value Beyond the Product\nYour prospects are not just buying a product or service - they are purchasing an experience and a set of positive emotions. They want to feel excited, reassured, and valued throughout the buying process and beyond. By focusing on the overall experience and the value you bring to the table, you can differentiate yourself from competitors and leave a lasting impression.\n\n### Addressing Fears and Doubts\nProspects may also be buying peace of mind and confidence in their decision. It's essential to address any fears or doubts they may have and provide reassurance through your expertise, support, and after-sales service.\n\n## Conclusion: Understanding Your Prospect's Needs\n\nWhen it comes down to it, your prospects are buying much more than just a product or service. They are investing in a solution to their problems, confidence and trust in your offering and the experience you provide, and positive emotions that come with their purchase. By truly understanding what motivates your prospects to buy, you can tailor your approach to meet their needs and foster long-term, loyal relationships.

As a sales professional, it's essential to understand what drives your potential customers to make a buying decision. It's not just about the features and benefits of your offering - it's about fulfilling deeper emotional and practical needs. Let's take a closer look at what your prospects are REALLY buying.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">The Solution to Their Problem</h2>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Understanding Pain Points</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">When prospects are considering a purchase, they are looking for a solution to a problem or a need they have.

They are investing in a solution to their problems, confidence and trust in your offering and the experience you provide, and positive emotions that come with their purchase. By truly understanding what motivates your prospects to buy, you can tailor your approach to meet their needs and foster long-term, loyal relationships.

What does that actually mean for you and me? Especially as we navigate uncertain waters, uncharted territory, as things in the world look very different than they did just a short while ago.\u00a0\n\nThis is a year for changes. It's a decade for change. I know that there was a rallying cry at the end of 2019, that 2020 was going to be different. And boy has it ever been different.\n\nThis is just the beginning. It\u2019s important to understand the topic of diversity, equity and inclusion. And for those of you who are not of color, understanding your ability to be an ally to people of color is extremely important for you to know that this is a marathon, not a sprint, and this is not going to be done overnight.\n\nThis episode is going to be both teaching and sharing, and I want your input. Regardless of where you're listening right now, come over to my podcast page and share with me openly, honestly, your thoughts. We are diving deep into the topic of what it means to have diversity and to be inclusive and equitable and what does this mean for our and your business.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBiggest Takeaways:\u00a0\n\n \tAllyship is a lifelong process of building relationships based on trust, consistency and accountability with marginalized individuals or groups of people. Like sales is based on building relationships. It's based on trust, consistency and accountability.\n \tTake a look at your core values. Does it accurately reflect what you want to put out in the world? Do you need to have something that allows you more flexibility around being more inclusive in your language, more diversity and focused in your hiring practices or the way that you have people on your team represented?\n \tThis is shifting the way that we all do business, regardless of what your fundamental belief might be. For diversity equity and inclusion, it means that we're going to be able to see change. And more importantly, that we're going to be part of the change.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHighlights:\n\n \tThe first step into the journey of allyship [07:19]\n \tA story my friend shared with me about being pulled over by the police. How she was able to lead with compassion and be direct, but at the same time, be respectful and allow this police officer to see her point of view. [09:45]\n \tWhy you may be indirectly discriminating against the people that you desperately want to serve. [12:15]\n \tWhen it\u2019s no longer okay to simply have good intentions. It is much more important now that you have the ability to understand the impact of your intentions, words, and the choices that you're making. [15:00]\n \tThe first step into opening up the conversation [16:41]\n \tHow to continually improve as it is a marathon, not a sprint [18:31]\n \tWhy you need internal policies and how to communicate them to your team [21:27]\n \tPutting your money where your mouth is - When you do things in a way that makes your customers feel like you're congruent to them, it no longer feels like selling. It feels like an intimate relationship and somebody who really understands them.

low ticket offers.\u00a0\n\nWhen you might be thinking about having the high ticket offer or a low ticket offer and why do you actually need to have both? And we're going to flip the funnel on this one.\u00a0\n\nI'm also going to share with you what I feel you need to do first, especially if you are newer in your business or have a smaller audience.\u00a0\n\nEven if you are established in business and you've been offline in a traditional brick and mortar business, and now you're going digital, I'm going to tell you why high ticket offers are the way to go.\n\nIn this episode, we\u2019ll discuss the age old debate - how much do I charge?\n\nBiggest Takeaways:\u00a0\n\n \tPassive income is a misnomer, meaning that it's not really that passive. You still have to do work, but relative to the output, the return, it's a lot less work.\n \tWhen you look at people, a higher touch, more personalized experience, they are more loyal and you build better relationships. It's one of the reasons why I highly recommend having a high ticket offer within your offerings.\n \tIf you don't have a high-ticket offer, implement at least one to generate as much income as you can, to hit your income target, and then start to fill in the gaps with your lower priced offers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHighlights:\n\n \tSelling low ticket offers [02:30]\n \tWhy passive income really isn\u2019t that passive [03:46]\n \t3 main considerations you need to figure out if a low ticket business model is one that you need to focus on right now [04:07]\n \tWhat I did to build a six figure business within six months with a wait list [10:55]\n \t3 main considerations for selling high ticket offers [12:14]\n \tHow I went completely low tech and what I actually focused on to get clients [16:05]\n \tWhy you don\u2019t need to set up another funnel or create another landing page in order to sell [20:17]\n \tHow to \u201cflip the funnel\u201d to attract high-end clients so that you can make your income goals faster.

The Million Dollar Question of What Price to Sell At\n\nPricing your product or service is a crucial aspect of sales, balancing between quality and the price tag. The challenge often lies in choosing between high prices that might deter customers and low prices that could affect profitability. The key is finding the sweet spot in pricing for increased sales and customer satisfaction.\n\n## Understanding the Psychology of Pricing\n\nPricing isn't just a number; it's a message about your product's value. Here's how pricing psychology affects consumer behavior:\n\n### Perception of Value\n\nYour price signals your product's value. High prices can imply quality and exclusivity, while low prices may attract budget-conscious customers. Knowing your target market's values helps in setting the right price.\n\n### Impact on Sales\n\nPricing affects sales volume and profit margins. High prices might mean fewer sales but higher margins, whereas low prices can increase customer numbers but reduce profitability. Balancing sales volume and profit is key.\n\n### Building Trust and Loyalty\n\nFair pricing builds customer trust and loyalty. Customers who feel they're getting value are more likely to be repeat buyers and recommend your business.\n\n## Finding the Sweet Spot\n\nHere are tips to find the right price:\n\n### Know Your Costs\n\nUnderstand all your costs, including production, overhead, and marketing. This ensures your pricing covers costs and remains profitable.\n\n### Understand Your Market\n\nResearch your industry's pricing. This gives you a benchmark and helps position your product effectively.\n\n### Test Different Prices\n\nExperiment with various prices to see how they influence customer behavior. Small changes can reveal a lot about customer value perception.\n\n### Communicate Value\n\nMake sure customers understand the value of your product. This can justify higher prices and show why your product is worth the investment.\n\n### Monitor and Adjust\n\nPricing should be dynamic. Regularly review and adjust your pricing strategy based on market trends and customer feedback.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSetting the right price is challenging but crucial. Understanding pricing psychology, knowing your costs, and continually adapting your strategy can help you find the perfect balance. Pricing is about creating value for customers and ensuring your business's sustainability and success.",

RedCircleIf you're wondering where the heck are my clients. How do I get more clients? I need more leads? This episode is going to break down for you.\u00a0I will discuss exactly why the number of leads is not the problem and what you need to focus on instead to create a never ending supply of those leads of dream clients. Because it's really not about the quantity, it's about something else instead.\u00a0This is a popular myth out there that the marketers have. You believe that it is about a constant flow of leads. And don't get me wrong, you need to have a certain quantity of leads. However, typically when I'm talking to coaches and consultants and experts like you, it\u2019s not because you have a shortage of leads.

        "human_post": "# Why More Leads Won't Solve Your Sales Problem\n\nSo you've been working hard to generate more leads for your business, but for some reason, your sales numbers just aren't where you want them to be. It's frustrating, isn't it? You put in all this effort to attract new potential customers, only to find that they're not converting into actual sales. But before you go on a lead generation frenzy, let's take a step back and figure out if there's a deeper issue at play. \n\n## The Quality of Leads Matters\nGenerating more leads may seem like the obvious solution to increasing sales, but the real issue might be the quality of the leads you're attracting. \n\n### Target Audience\nAre you reaching the right people? It's crucial to make sure that your marketing efforts are targeted towards your ideal customers. If you're attracting leads who are not a good fit for your product or service, it's no wonder they're not converting into sales.\n\n### Qualified Leads\nNot all leads are created equal. You might have a large number of leads, but if they're not qualified or genuinely interested in what you have to offer, then they're just taking up space in your pipeline.\n\n## The Sales Process Matters \nAnother reason why more leads won't necessarily solve your sales problem is the effectiveness of your sales process.\n\n### Follow-Up\nHow are you following up with your leads? If you're not nurturing them through the sales process, you're missing out on potential opportunities. It's essential to have a solid follow-up strategy in place to guide leads towards a purchase decision.\n\n### Conversion Rate \nEven if you have a steady flow of leads, if your conversion rate is low, it means there's a bottleneck in your sales process. You need to identify where leads are dropping off and optimize those touchpoints for better results.\n\n## Customer Experience Matters\nUltimately, it's all about the experience you provide for your potential customers.\n\n### Trust and Credibility \nAre you building trust and credibility with your leads? If they don't trust your brand or believe in the value you offer, they're unlikely to make a purchase.\n\n### Engagement \nHow engaged are your leads with your brand? Engaging leads through personalized communication and relevant content can significantly impact their likelihood to convert.\n\n## Conclusion\nBefore you pour more resources into lead generation, take a close look at the quality of your leads, the effectiveness of your sales process, and the experience you provide for potential customers. Addressing these areas may reveal underlying issues that, once fixed, could have a more significant impact on your sales than simply generating more leads. Remember, it's not just about quantity, but the quality and the overall experience that will ultimately drive sales success.",

        "human_post": "# What I'd Do Differently Starting Over Again\n\nHey there, fellow life traveler! Whether you're at a crossroads in your career, relationships, or personal development, starting over can be both daunting and exciting. If I could turn back time and start over again, there are a few things I'd do differently to make the journey smoother and more fulfilling. And I'm here to share those insights with you, so you can embark on your new adventure with confidence and clarity.\n\n## 1. Embrace the Learning Process\n\n### Openness to new experiences\nOne thing I'd do differently is to embrace the learning process wholeheartedly. Instead of fearing the unknown, I'd approach it with a sense of curiosity and openness to new experiences. Every challenge, setback, or change presents an opportunity to learn and grow. So, I'd remind myself to stay open-minded and welcome the lessons that come my way.\n\n### Willingness to adapt\nI'd also adopt a mindset of flexibility and adaptability. Life rarely follows a straight path, and being able to pivot when necessary is crucial. I'd tell myself that it's okay to change course, adjust my plans, and explore different options. Flexibility would be my mantra as I navigate the ups and downs of starting over.\n\n## 2. Build a Support System\n\n### Seeking guidance\nLooking back, I'd prioritize building a strong support system from the get-go. Whether it's seeking advice from mentors, connecting with like-minded individuals, or leaning on friends and family, having a support network is invaluable. I'd encourage myself to reach out for help, guidance, and encouragement along the way.\n\n### Surrounding myself with positivity\nIn addition, I'd be mindful of the company I keep. Surrounding myself with positive, empowering, and supportive individuals would be non-negotiable. Their belief in me, constructive feedback, and uplifting energy would fuel my journey forward.\n\n## 3. Set Clear Intentions and Goals\n\n### Defining my vision\nStarting over can feel overwhelming, which is why I'd emphasize the importance of setting clear intentions and defining my vision. What do I hope to achieve? What are my short-term and long-term goals? Having a roadmap, even if it's flexible, would provide me with a sense of direction and purpose.\n\n### Taking consistent action\nMoreover, I'd remind myself that progress stems from consistent action. It's not just about the end destination, but the steps I take each day to inch closer to my goals. I'd focus on small, achievable actions that align with my intentions, knowing that they compound over time.\n\n## 4. Practice Self-Compassion\n\n### Embracing self-care\nIn the midst of starting over, I'd make self-care a priority. Nurturing my physical, emotional, and mental well-being would be non-negotiable. Whether it's through meditation, exercise, hobbies, or simply taking time to recharge, I'd remind myself that self-care is not selfish; it's essential for resilience.\n\n### Showing kindness to myself\nLastly, I'd practice self-compassion during moments of doubt or difficulty. Starting over can be challenging, and it's okay to acknowledge the struggle. Instead of being overly self-critical, I'd show myself the same kindness and understanding that I would offer to a friend facing a similar situation.\n\nWith these insights in mind, I'd approach starting over as an opportunity for personal and professional reinvention. It's a chance to redefine my path, pursue my passions, and create a life that truly resonates with who I am. If you're embarking on a new beginning, remember that it's never too late to embrace change and chart a course that brings you fulfillment. Cheers to your journey ahead!\n\nReady to take the leap into your new beginning? What's the first step you're going to take? Let's chat about it in the comments below!",

        "human_post": "# Top 7 Lessons I Learned Since Starting My Business\n\nHi there, in this episode, I\u2019ll share the top 7 lessons I learned. Some lessons may be unexpected, some may surprise you and some may even allow you a sigh of relief. You\u2019re not alone in this as we all go through similar experiences in entrepreneurship.\n\n## 1. Taking action \n\nThis is the most important thing. The times that I have taken action over and over again are the times where I have seen the biggest improvements in my business. \n\n## 2. Be protective of your energy \n\nAs an introvert, I know that I need to recharge my battery to go back to my creative mind. I'm now ruthless about how I spend my time. If I have back to back calls today, I won't schedule back to back calls tomorrow. \n\n## 3. Why you don\u2019t need to explain yourself to the right people\n\nThe right people will stand by you. They will challenge you for sure. It\u2019s not about having a whole bunch of people surround you. It\u2019s about having the right people who know your intentions, your heart, what type of person you are and your area - how genius you are at the thing that you do.\n\n## 4.You can do anything but it doesn't mean that you have to do anything or everything\n\nIf I give myself enough space and time to do the things that I need to do, and I really think about what I need in my business. Whether or not that's me or somebody else in my business that needs to do it, anything is possible. Anything can be done. \n\n## 5. Progress not perfection\n\nI'm a recovering perfectionist. I learnt that I can just look for incremental improvements and it doesn't need to be perfect in order to send it out the gate. \n\n## 6. If it's not a hell yes than it's a hell no \n\nSaying yes left me burned out and left me exhausted and made me hate every part of my business. It doesn't matter if a client looks perfect on paper, if it's not working out, it is okay to let drop them as a client. \n\n## 7. Slow down to speed up \n\nIt\u2019s better to slow down to speed up because we don't want to have to spend a lot of time having to duplicate efforts and to redo things over and over again. We do this to get all of the pieces together and ensure that we are doing things, as much as possible, with excellence and without waiting for perfection.",

RedCircleWhen I first started in sales, and it may sound very familiar to you because if you're anything like I was, I never wanted to have a career in sales (if you haven't heard that story, click here to listen). In fact, even right now, sometimes the idea of having to sell just doesn't feel right.I teach that selling is serving because when people have a problem that is deeply painful and is preventing them from doing the thing that they desperately want to achieve in their life or business, you are their Knight in clean and shining armor.You're coming in with your offer and solution, and you're providing them an opportunity to get help. That's why it's so important that you understand the impact that you have in the world.In this episode, we\u2019ll talk about the toughest and the best sale you will ever make in your business and career.Biggest Takeaways:\u00a0Selling is serving and selling is actually a good thing to do.

RedCircleWe are talking all about the difference between 2Ps. They are the difference between being persistent and pushy.If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cI need to follow up with people. I'm really scared. I don't know the fine line that I need to walk between being persistent or being pushy too often\u2026\u201c. I hear from my clients who are worried about being seen as that sleazy salesperson, simply because they're being persistent, right?They want to follow up. They understand that fortune is in the followup, but they don't know how to balance that and be pleasantly persistent without being overly pushy.In today's episode, we're going to break down the difference between these two states. Why one is so negative, and the other a much more positive state of being. That\u2019s the one that I want you to focus on.Biggest Takeaways: Sales take time. It takes time to build a pipeline. It takes time to build relationships.When you achieve your goals, it is not just about the money and the outcome of that money or the dollar value. It\u2019s really about that ripple effect that it creates with the people that you're here to serve. It allows you to be relentless in pursuit of that achievement.Instead of worrying about being pushy, think about how you can continually be persistent in the face of those obstacles and challenges. How you can be obstinate in continuance in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition.Highlights:Why being persistent is an important to have as a business owner [01:44]What persistence vs pushy really means [03:22]Sales is not a one-sided thing. How you can create a win-win situation for both you and your potential customers. [05:13]The thing that allows you to make offers not only from a money standpoint, but also from an opportunity standpoint. [06:39]How to be more persistent without being pushy [07:48]You need to be persistent because potential clients will need anywhere from 5 to 12, or sometimes up to 18 different touch points before they buy from you [11:50]Resources to Help You Master The Sales Game!They are the perfect companion to my Master The Sales Game podcast, so you can take the next step to getting more of those sales \ud83d\ude0a6-Figure Blueprint - With this blueprint, learn the 3 simple proven ways to get calls booked so you can generate clients on demand!

When you confuse people, people don't buy. They just move on to the next thing.\nBeing social on social media helps you to sell more. It does not need to take hours upon hours a day. You simply need an understanding what it is that the social media platform wants and how humans behave on each of these platforms.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nWhy you shouldn\u2019t treat all platforms the same [02:56]\nWhen being incongruent with your content will confuse your audience [07:52]\nHow do you balance selling VS giving value [13:09]\nWhen you\u2019re constantly doing a new thing every single time, it\u2019s gonna be really tough to make it work [17:15]\nWhy as an introvert, I go through a love/hate relationship with social media. How to spend some very specific targeted time on social media so you\u2019re on it 24/7 [21:40]\n\n\u00a0\nWant to magnetize dream clients who say YES on the spot?\nIf you know that you need some help around really dialing in your messaging and how to get buyers for your programs before you've even created them so that they could be sold out, I\u2019ve got something for you.\n\u00a0\nWhat if you knew with certainty and with confidence that people were excited for what it was that you were about to put out there in the world?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI wanna invite you to join me for my upcoming program.

Treating all platforms the same \nIn order to be successful on social media, you don't need to be on all social media platforms. I knew that social media is the easiest way to connect and convert my audience into paying customers to gain sales. I only picked one platform to grow to six figures and I gave content that audience needed to hear. \n\n## 2. Confusing your audience \nYou are being incongurent with the content that you are putting out. When you confuse, you lose. When you confuse people, people don't buy. They just move on to the next thing.\n\n## 3. You are only selling or you are only posting value \nI can't tell you often you need to sell but I can tell you that if you are not seeing results, something is probably not right with the way you are selling. How do I strike that balance? I like to teach my clients how to sell and give value at the same time. You won't see results if you are only doing one. \n\n## 4. Spray and pray \nYou are just saying the same thing over and over again and praying that it will work. If you are constantly doing a new thing every single time, it will be hard to see results. \n\n## 5. Not being social \nAs an introvert, I go through a love/hate relationship with social media. You have to be social but you don't need to be an extrovert. ",

People have different personalities, perceptions, preferences and desires, but that\u2019s not all that influences when making a sale or negotiating with your client.\nDid you know you may be upsetting or ignoring the gender responsible for the majority of purchasing decisions being made?\nThe truth is that old, outdated and very masculine sales methods aren\u2019t working anymore.\u00a0\nIn today's episode we will talk about a very important topic, which unfortunately is often ignored or often unknown. Let\u2019s dive into how to sell to the genders.\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\u00a0\n\nAs a business owner you need to understand there are gender differences in how people buy. Selling without this consideration is isolating buyers.\u00a0\nWomen don't want to ask permission, women want to collaborate. They want to bounce off ideas and look at things from different perspectives.\nGenders are different and have subtle nuances.\nYour branding on your marketing collateral is not the only way to get more sales (AKA pink doesn\u2019t make you sell more to women).\nSelling to different genders doesn't mean you have to change your  personality. It means that you must know how to deal in different ways.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nThe Traditional view on how to sell [02:58]\nThe Male Dominant View that is Not Appreciated by Your Female Audience [04:39]\nReal Situations: How to Deal with Different Genders [05:51]\nWho Controls Money spent in Today\u2019s World?

        "human_post": "# How to Make More Money Efficiently With Your Customer Service \ud83d\udcb5\n\nCustomer service is not just about solving problems and answering inquiries. It's also an incredible opportunity to increase your revenue and build customer loyalty. In fact, studies show that consumers are willing to spend more with businesses that offer great customer service. So, if you're looking to make more money efficiently with your customer service, you're in the right place. Here's how you can turn your customer service into a revenue-generating powerhouse.\n\n## Improve Response Time\n\n### Implement Live Chat\nOne of the most efficient ways to boost your customer service revenue is by implementing a live chat feature on your website. This allows your customers to get real-time assistance, leading to faster query resolutions and a higher chance of conversion.\n\n### Use Chatbots\nChatbots can give instant responses to common customer queries, freeing up your human agents to handle more complex issues. This ensures that customers get a prompt reply, improving satisfaction and potentially leading to more sales.\n\n## Upsell and Cross-sell\n\n### Train Your Agents\nGive your customer service team with training on upselling and cross-selling techniques. They can subtly introduce customers to additional products or services that complement their original purchase, increasing the average order value.\n\n### Personalize Recommendations\nUse customer data to personalize upsell and cross-sell recommendations. By understanding customer preferences and purchase history, you can suggest relevant offerings that are more likely to resonate with them.\n\n## Offer Proactive Support\n\n### Anticipate Needs\nProactively reach out to customers who may need assistance based on their behavior or the products they've shown interest in. By addressing potential concerns before they escalate, you can prevent churn and increase customer lifetime value.\n\n### Provide Value-added Resources\nCreate and share educational content, such as how-to guides, video tutorials, or product demonstrations. Not only does this help customers make the most of their purchases, but it also positions your brand as a helpful authority, fostering trust and loyalty.\n\n## Leverage Customer Feedback\n\n### Gather Customer Insights\nRegularly collect feedback from your customers regarding their experience with your products and service. Use this information to identify areas for improvement and tailor your offerings to better meet their needs.\n\n### Turn Feedback Into Action\nShow your customers that their feedback matters by implementing changes based on their suggestions. This not only demonstrates that you value their input but can also lead to increased satisfaction and loyalty.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy focusing on improving response time, leveraging upselling and cross-selling, offering proactive support, and leveraging customer feedback, you can transform your customer service efforts into a powerful revenue-generating engine. Remember, it's not just about resolving issues \u2013 it's about creating exceptional experiences that drive sales and foster long-term customer relationships. So, go ahead and take your customer service to the next level to see a definite impact on your bottom line!",

Sending proposals when you haven\u2019t properly sold your services is not what\u2019s going to get your customers to buy. Making money, growing your customer base and creating value for your business and for the world doesn't have to be difficult or complicated. It can be easy if you have a process and\nThe term \u201cempathy\u201d is used to describe a wide range of experiences. Emotion researchers generally define empathy as the ability to sense other people\u2019s emotions, coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else might be thinking or feeling. In other words: The ability to share someone else's feelings or experiences by imagining what it would be like to be in that person's situation. One of the most important things in the process of mastering the sales game is to study empathy not only as a feeling, but also as a mindset on how to solve problems, understand demands and present a solid proposal that helps your customers have the best solution for their needs. In this episode you will learn the full meaning of empathy in the sales world and how to use it to leverage your sales and impact in the world. Are you ready?

        "human_post": "# All You Need to Know About Leads\n\nAre you ready to take your business to the next level? \ud83e\udd1d\n\nThen you need to understand the importance of leads. In the world of sales and marketing, leads are the lifeblood of a successful business. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned entrepreneur or just starting out, mastering the art of generating and nurturing leads is essential for growth. \n\n## What are Leads?\n\nLeads are prospects who have shown interest in your product or service. They could be individuals or organizations who have expressed interest by providing their contact details or engaging with your business in some way. Leads come in various forms, such as cold leads, warm leads, and hot leads, depending on their level of interest and readiness to make a purchase.\n\n### Types of Leads\n\n1. Cold leads: These are individuals or businesses who have shown minimal interest in your offerings and may need more nurturing before making a purchase.\n2. Warm leads: These leads have shown moderate interest and may be considering your products or services as a solution to their needs.\n3. Hot leads: These are highly interested prospects who are likely to make a purchase soon.\n\n## The Importance of Leads\n\nLeads are the backbone of any successful business. Without a steady stream of potential customers, your business will struggle to grow and thrive. Here are a few reasons why leads are crucial:\n\n### Business Growth\n\nLeads are key for expanding your customer base and increasing sales. By consistently generating and nurturing leads, you can ensure a steady flow of new customers into your business.\n\n### Relationship Building\n\nEffective lead generation allows you to build relationships with potential customers. By giving valuable information and engaging with leads, you can gain trust and credibility, making it more likely for them to convert into paying customers.\n\n### Sales Opportunities\n\nLeads represent potential sales opportunities. The more leads you have in your pipeline, the greater your chance of converting them into paying customers.\n\n### Market Insights\n\nEngaging with leads provides valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences. Knowing your target audience\u2019s needs and pain points can help you tailor your products or services to better meet their requirements.\n\n## How to Generate Leads\n\nNow that you understand the importance of leads, it\u2019s critical to know how to generate them effectively.\n\n### Identify Your Target Audience\n\nUnderstanding your ideal customer is key to lead generation. Take the time to create buyer personas that represent your target audience.

Is it the process or product that we are selling? Is it how we negotiate? If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cI need to follow up with people. I'm really scared. I don't know the fine line that I need to walk between being persistent or being pushy too often\u2026\u201c\nIn today's episode, we're going to break down the difference between these two states. Why one is so negative, and the other a much more positive state of being. That\u2019s the one that I want you to focus on. Also, \u00a0I'm going to be sharing a story that helps explain the key foundation piece that I believe is essential for all authentic sales conversations and really all authentic sales. So, let's dive in!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSales take time. It takes time to build a pipeline. It takes time to build relationships.\nWhen you achieve your goals, it is not just about the money and the outcome of that money or the dollar value. It\u2019s really about that ripple effect that it creates with the people that you're here to serve. It allows you to be relentless in pursuit of that achievement.\nInstead of worrying about being pushy, think about how you can continually be persistent in the face of those obstacles and challenges. How you can be obstinate in continuance in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition.\nAn aggressive selling method is the opposite of authenticity\nApathy and being passive doesn't bring you the results you want. Do it with confidence and energy!\nWe are all trying to sell something. Read \u201cTo Sell is Human\u201d (Daniel Pink)\nYou're making decisions all the time. And if you're not making them, somebody else is making them for you.\nIf your product is something that your customer doesn't need, there is no point in selling it. Selling is serving, but it\u2019s also more than that.\nHelp your customers get what they need.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nWhen do things become incongruent?

        "human_post_html": "<h1 class=\"h1-class\">How to develop a Sales person Mindset</h1>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Hey there, sales superstars! </p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Are you looking to level up your game and develop a salesperson mindset that gets you closing deals left and right?</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Well, you've come to the right place!</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">In this blog post, we're going to dive into the key traits and habits that will help you develop the mindset of a successful salesperson. </p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">So, grab a cup of coffee, get comfy, and let's get started!</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Embrace a growth mindset</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">The first step to developing a salesperson mindset is to adopt a growth mindset. This means believing that your abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work. It's all about embracing challenges, learning from feedback, and finding inspiration in the success of others. </p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Set clear goals</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Setting clear and achievable goals is crucial for a salesperson. Whether it's a daily call quota, a monthly sales target, or a long-term career objective, having solid goals to work towards will keep you motivated and focused. Write them down, track your progress, and celebrate your wins along the way.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Believe in what you're selling</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">To succeed in sales, you need to genuinely believe in the product or service you're offering. When you have faith in what you're selling, it shines through in your conversations with prospects. Your passion and confidence will be contagious, making it easier to close deals and build lasting relationships with clients.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Develop resilience</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Let's face it \u2013 rejection is a part of the sales game. But the most successful salespeople don't let a few \"no's\" get them down. Developing resilience means bouncing back from setbacks, staying positive, and learning from every experience. Remember, every \"no\" gets you closer to a \"yes.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Hone your communication skills</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Effective communication is at the core of sales. Whether it's active listening, asking the right questions, or tailoring your pitch to each prospect, honing your communication skills is essential for success. Take the time to practice and refine your ability to convey your message clearly and persuasively.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Stay customer-focused</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Great salespeople always put the customer first. This means taking the time to understand their needs, addressing their concerns, and providing tailored solutions. Building trust and rapport with your clients will not only lead to more sales but also to referrals and repeat business.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Learn from the best</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Success leaves clues, so why not learn from those who have already achieved what you aspire to?</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Seek out mentors, read books, listen to podcasts, and attend workshops led by successful sales professionals. Absorb their wisdom, adopt their strategies, and adapt them to fit your own unique style.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Practice self-discipline</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">In the world of sales, self-discipline is key. It's about staying organized, managing your time effectively, and maintaining a strong work ethic. Create a daily routine, prioritize your tasks, and stay accountable to yourself. Remember, consistency is the cornerstone of success.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Developing a salesperson mindset takes time, dedication, and a willingness to continuously learn and grow. By adopting a growth mindset, setting clear goals, believing in your product, and mastering essential skills, you'll be well on your way to becoming a top-notch sales superstar. </p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">So, go out there, embrace the challenges, and watch your sales soar!</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">There you have it, folks \u2013 the essential steps to developing a salesperson mindset. Now, go out there and crush those sales goals! </p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">You've got this. And remember, success in sales is not just about making a sale; it's about building relationships and making a positive impact. So, keep hustling, keep learning, and keep shining bright in the world of sales.</p>\n",

        "human_post": "# How Do the Rich Make Money?\n\nHey there, \ud83d\udc4b\n\nHave you ever wondered how the wealthy seem to keep getting wealthier? \n\nIt's a question that many of us ask ourselves, especially when we're trying to find our own financial footing. The truth is, the rich have a few key strategies that they use to grow and maintain their wealth. And the good news is, these strategies are accessible to anyone who is willing to put in the work. So, let's take a closer look at how the rich make their money and how you can apply these principles to your own financial journey.\n\n## Investing in Assets\n\nOne of the most common ways that the rich make money is by investing in assets. These can include stocks, real estate, businesses, and more. The key here is to put your money into things that have the potential to grow in value over time. Here are a few types of assets that the wealthy often invest in:\n\n### Real Estate\nInvesting in real estate has long been a favored strategy of the wealthy. Whether it's through rental properties, commercial real estate, or real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate can provide both ongoing income and the potential for appreciation.\n\n### Stocks and Bonds\nMany wealthy individuals also invest in the stock market and bonds. This allows them to benefit from the growth of successful companies and receive income from dividend-paying stocks and interest-paying bonds.\n\n### Businesses\nEntrepreneurship is another avenue that the rich often pursue. By starting or investing in businesses, they can create multiple streams of income and build substantial wealth over time.\n\n## Building Passive Income Streams\n\nAnother key strategy that the wealthy use to make money is building passive income streams. This involves creating sources of income that require minimal ongoing effort to maintain. Here are a few examples of passive income streams:\n\n### Rental Income\nAs mentioned earlier, rental properties can be a great source of passive income. Once the initial work of acquiring and managing the property is done, it can generate ongoing income with relatively little effort.\n\n### Dividend Income\nInvesting in dividend-paying stocks and funds can provide a steady stream of passive income. This can be especially valuable in retirement or as a supplement to other sources of income.\n\n### Royalties\nFor those with creative talents, such as writing, music, or art, royalties from intellectual property can provide ongoing income with minimal ongoing work.\n\n## Leveraging Debt and Assets\n\nContrary to popular belief, the wealthy often use debt to their advantage. By strategically leveraging debt, they can acquire assets and investments that have the potential to grow in value and generate income. Here are a few ways that the rich use debt and assets to make money:\n\n### Using Leverage\nFor example, many real estate investors use mortgages to purchase properties, allowing them to control a valuable asset with a relatively small initial investment.\n\n### Business Loans\nEntrepreneurs often use loans to start or expand businesses, with the expectation that the return on investment will outweigh the cost of the debt.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAt the end of the day, the strategies that the rich use to make money are ultimately about building and growing wealth over time. By investing in assets, building passive income streams, and leveraging debt and assets, anyone can set themselves on a path toward financial success. It's important to remember that these strategies require patience, perseverance, and a willingness to take calculated risks. But with the right approach and a long-term mindset, you can apply these principles to your own financial journey and work towards achieving your own version of wealth and financial freedom!\n\nSo, keep learning, keep growing, and keep taking steps towards your financial goals. You've got this!",

By investing in assets, building passive income streams, and leveraging debt and assets, anyone can set themselves on a path toward financial success. It's important to remember that these strategies require patience, perseverance, and a willingness to take calculated risks. But with the right approach and a long-term mindset, you can apply these principles to your own financial journey and work towards achieving your own version of wealth and financial freedom!</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">So, keep learning, keep growing, and keep taking steps towards your financial goals. You've got this!</p>\n",

        "human_post": "# Key Strategies to Get Clients Saying YES More Frequently\n\nAre you tired of constantly hearing \"I'll think about it\" or \"Let me get back to you\" from potential clients? \n\nGetting clients to say yes can be challenging, but with the right strategies, you can increase your conversion rate and see more positive responses. \n\n## Understand Your Client's Needs and Pain Points\n\nTo get clients saying yes, it's key to understand their needs and pain points. When you can clearly articulate the problems they are facing, it becomes easier to present your solutions in a compelling way. \n\n### Conduct thorough research \nBefore meeting with a client, take the time to research their industry, company, and the challenges they may be encountering. The more you know about their situation, the better equipped you'll be to offer relevant solutions.\n\n### Ask probing questions \nDuring your interactions with clients, ask open-ended questions to uncover their pain points and goals. This will help you tailor your offerings to address their specific needs, making it more likely for them to respond with a yes.\n\n## Build Trust and Credibility\n\nClients are more likely to say yes when they trust you and believe in your expertise. Gaining trust and credibility should be a priority in all your client interactions.\n\n### Share success stories \nHighlight past successes and case studies to showcase your track record. When clients see evidence of your ability to deliver results, they are more likely to have confidence in saying yes to your proposal.\n\n### Provide valuable insights \nOffer valuable industry insights and expertise to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of their challenges. This positions you as a trusted advisor rather than just a salesperson.\n\n## Clearly Articulate the Value You Provide\n\nClients need to see the value in what you're offering in order to say yes. Clearly articulating the value you provide is essential in securing their commitment.\n\n### Focus on benefits \nInstead of just listing features, focus on how your offering will benefit the client. \n\n- Will it save them time? \n- Make them more efficient? \n- Increase their revenue? \n\nPaint a clear picture of the positive impact your solution will have on their business.\n\n### Use storytelling \nWeave compelling stories into your presentations to illustrate how your offering has made a difference for other clients. Stories create an emotional connection and make the value more tangible for the client.\n\n## Overcome Objections Proactively\n\nObjections are inevitable in sales, but how you handle them can make all the difference in getting a yes from your clients.\n\n### Anticipate objections \nPut yourself in the client's shoes and anticipate potential objections they may raise. Address these concerns proactively in your pitch to alleviate any hesitations.\n\n### Provide evidence and rationale \nWhen addressing objections, provide evidence and rationale to support your points. This demonstrates that you've thoroughly considered their concerns and have credible responses.\n\n## Create a Sense of Urgency\n\nCreating a sense of urgency can prompt clients to make a decision sooner rather than later. By showing that there are immediate benefits to saying yes, you can increase the likelihood of a positive response.\n\n### Limited-time offers \nOffering limited-time promotions or incentives can motivate clients to act quickly. Whether it's a discount or a bonus service, creating a sense of urgency can tip the scales towards a yes.\n\n### Highlight potential losses \nIllustrate the potential losses or missed opportunities if the client doesn't take action. By highlighting what they stand to lose, you can nudge them towards a decision in your favor.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGetting clients to say yes doesn't have to feel like an uphill battle. By understanding your client's needs, building trust, articulating value, overcoming objections, and creating a sense of urgency, you can increase the frequency of positive responses. Remember, it's not just about making a sale \u2013 it's about delivering real value to your clients. \n\nWhen you focus on helping them achieve their goals, the yeses will naturally follow! ",

In this blog post, we'll discuss how you can be authentic and earn money with recurring revenue streams.\n\n## Embrace Your Authenticity\n\n### Identify Your Passion and Skills\nThe 1st step to earning money with recurring revenue is to identify your passion and skills. \n\n- What are you truly passionate about? \n- What skills do you possess that could be valuable to others? \n\nTake some time to reflect on what you love to do and what comes naturally to you. Whether it's writing, crafting, coaching, or any other talent, embrace your authenticity and recognize the value it holds.\n\n### Share Your Story\nAuthenticity is about being genuine and transparent. Share your story with the world. Let people know who you are and what experiences have shaped you. Your authenticity will attract like-minded individuals who resonate with your journey. Being relatable and open about your struggles and triumphs can help build trust and a loyal following.\n\n## Build Recurring Revenue Streams\n\n### Create Valuable Content\nOnce you've embraced your authenticity, it's time to create valuable content. Whether it's through writing blogs, filming videos, recording podcasts, or offering online courses, share your knowledge and expertise with your audience. Provide content that educates, inspires, and entertains. By consistently offering value, you'll attract a loyal audience that is willing to invest in your offerings.\n\n### Offer Subscription Services\nConsider giving subscription services that provide ongoing value to your audience. This could be a membership site, a monthly coaching program, or a digital subscription to exclusive content. By offering consistent and valuable resources to your subscribers, you can generate steady recurring revenue while building a community around your brand.\n\n### Leverage Affiliate Marketing\nAnother way to gain recurring revenue authentically is through affiliate marketing. Partner with companies and products that align with your values and resonate with your audience. Promote these products authentically and provide genuine recommendations based on your own experiences. By doing so, you can earn passive income through recurring commissions from your referrals.\n\n## Cultivate Genuine Connections\n\n### Engage with Your Audience\nAuthenticity in business is all about building genuine connections. Engage with your audience on social media, through email newsletters, and in online communities. Respond to comments, answer questions, and show appreciation for your supporters. By nurturing these relationships, you'll create a loyal following that is willing to support your recurring revenue streams.\n\n### Seek Feedback and Adapt\nListen to your audience and seek their feedback. \n\n- What are their pain points, needs, and desires? \n- Use this valuable insight to adapt and refine your offerings.\n\nBy continuously improving based on genuine feedback, you'll demonstrate that you care about your audience's experience and are committed to providing authentic value.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEarning money with recurring revenue while staying authentic is achievable. By embracing your authenticity, building recurring revenue streams, and cultivating genuine connections, you can create a sustainable and fulfilling income. Remember, authenticity is your superpower \u2013 it sets you apart and attracts those who resonate with your genuine self. Stay true to your passion, provide value to your audience, and watch as your authentic approach rewards you with a steady income and a loyal following. \n\nIt's time to step into your authenticity and embrace the abundance that comes with it!

        "human_post": "# How to Help Prospective Clients Buy From You Using Urgency\n\nAs a sales professional, one of your main goals is to convert prospective clients into paying customers. One powerful tool in your sales arsenal is creating a sense of urgency that compels potential buyers to make a decision and take action. By leveraging urgency effectively, you can guide prospects through the buying process and increase your conversion rates. \n\nIn this post, we'll explore how to help prospective clients buy from you using urgency.\n\n## Understanding the Power of Urgency\n\nBefore we go into the strategies for using urgency to drive sales, let's first understand why it's such a potent force in the buying process. Urgency triggers a psychological response in individuals, prompting them to act quickly in order to avoid missing out on a valuable opportunity. When prospects feel a sense of urgency, they are more likely to make a purchase decision, as they fear the consequences of delaying or hesitating.\n\n## Creating Urgency in Your Sales Process\n\nNow that we recognize the influence of urgency, let's explore how you can incorporate it into your sales approach.\n\n### Limited-Time Offers\n\nOne of the most effective ways to instill urgency in prospective clients is by presenting them with limited-time offers. Whether it's a discount, a special promotion, or exclusive access to a product or service, clearly communicating that the offer will expire within a specific timeframe compels prospects to act decisively.\n\n### Scarcity Marketing\n\nHighlighting scarcity in your sales pitch can also drive prospects to take action. Emphasize limited stock availability, a finite number of slots for your service, or a deadline for placing an order to create a sense of scarcity that encourages swift decision-making.\n\n### Social Proof and FOMO\n\nUse social proof and the fear of missing out (FOMO) to reinforce the urgency of making a purchase. Sharing testimonials, reviews, and success stories from satisfied customers can demonstrate the value of your offering and intensify the desire for prospects to join the ranks of happy clients.\n\n## Aligning Urgency with Prospects' Needs\n\nWhile urgency can be a potent motivator, it's key to align it with the genuine needs and interests of your prospective clients. The goal is not to pressure or manipulate individuals into buying from you, but rather to assist them in recognizing the timeliness and relevance of your offering in fulfilling their requirements.\n\n### Identifying Pain Points\n\nUnderstand the pain points and challenges your prospects are facing, and position your product or service as a solution with a time-sensitive opportunity attached. When prospects see how your offering addresses their immediate needs, they are more likely to respond to the urgency you've highlighted.\n\n### Tailoring Urgency to Each Prospect\n\nEvery prospect may have unique motivations and priorities. By personalizing your approach and demonstrating how the urgency aligns with their specific circumstances, you can effectively drive home the message that acting promptly will benefit them.\n\n## Communicating Urgency Effectively\n\nThe way you convey urgency in your interactions with prospects can significantly impact their receptiveness and willingness to buy from you.\n\n### Clear and Transparent Messaging\n\nWhen communicating urgency, be transparent and honest with your prospects. Clearly articulate the reason for the urgency, such as limited inventory, time-bound incentives, or upcoming price changes, to establish credibility and trust.\n\n### Consistent yet Respectful Follow-Up\n\nFollowing up with prospects to reinforce the urgency of the opportunity is important, but it should be done in a respectful and non-intrusive manner. Striking a balance between reminding prospects of the time-sensitive nature of the offer and respecting their decision-making process is key.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIncorporating urgency into your sales strategy can be a game-changer in guiding prospective clients to buy from you. By understanding the psychological impact of urgency, aligning it with prospects' needs, and communicating it effectively, you can drive conversions and build lasting relationships with your customers. Remember, urgency is not just about making a sale; it's about helping prospects recognize the value of your offering and empowering them to make informed decisions that benefit them. \n\nSo go ahead, leverage urgency with empathy and integrity, and watch your sales soar!",

        "human_post": "# How to Succeed As a Multi Passionate Visionary Entrepreneur\n\nAre you someone with a multitude of passions and a big vision for your entrepreneurial pursuits? \n\nYou're not alone. Many people find themselves drawn to multiple interests and ideas, and want to explore and pursue them all in their entrepreneurial journey. Being a multi-passionate visionary entrepreneur can be incredibly rewarding, but it also comes with its own unique set of challenges.\n\nIf you're ready to embrace your multi-passionate nature and turn it into a successful entrepreneurial venture, here are some tips to help you along the way.\n\n## Embrace Your Multitude of Passions\n\nAs a multi-passionate visionary entrepreneur, it's key to embrace all of your passions and understand that they are part of what makes you unique. Instead of trying to narrow down your interests or force yourself to choose just one path, give yourself permission to explore and pursue all of your passions. This can be the key to finding fulfillment and success in your entrepreneurial journey.\n\n### Identify Your Core Values\n\nWhen you have multiple passions, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed or scattered.\n\nTo avoid feeling lost in the sea of possibilities, take the time to identify your core values. \n\n- What drives you? \n- What are the common threads that run through all of your passions? \n- Understanding your core values can help you create a cohesive vision that aligns with all of your passions.\n\n### Connect the Dots\n\nRather than viewing your passions as separate entities, look for ways to connect the dots and integrate them into a unified vision. Consider how your various interests and skills can complement each other and create something truly unique. By finding the common ground between your passions, you can create a business or career that is both diverse and cohesive.\n\n## Cultivate a Growth Mindset\n\nEmbracing your multi-passionate nature as a visionary entrepreneur requires a growth mindset. This means being open to learning, adapting, and evolving as you pursue your entrepreneurial endeavors. Instead of seeing challenges as roadblocks, view them as opportunities for growth and innovation.\n\n### Stay Flexible\n\nIn a fast-paced and ever-changing business landscape, flexibility is key. As a multi-passionate entrepreneur, be willing to pivot, adjust, and explore new possibilities. This flexibility can help you adapt to changing market trends and unlock new opportunities across your various passions.\n\n### Embrace Failure\n\nFailure is a natural part of the entrepreneurial journey, and when you're pursuing multiple passions, the risk of failure may feel even more daunting. Embrace failure as a learning experience and an opportunity to grow. Each setback can provide valuable insights that will ultimately contribute to your success.\n\n## Seek Support and Collaboration\n\nAs a multi-passionate visionary entrepreneur, seeking support and collaboration can be instrumental in your success. Building a strong network of like-minded individuals can provide you with valuable resources, guidance, and inspiration.\n\n### Surround Yourself with a Diverse Community\n\nConnect with other multi-passionate entrepreneurs, mentors, and peers who understand the unique challenges and opportunities that come with pursuing multiple passions. A diverse community can provide you with fresh perspectives and support as you navigate your entrepreneurial journey.\n\n### Collaborate with Complementary Partners\n\nLook for opportunities to collaborate with individuals or businesses that complement your various passions. By partnering with others, you can leverage each other's strengths and create innovative solutions that bridge the gap between your different interests.\n\n## Stay Organized and Prioritize Self-Care\n\nWith multiple passions and projects, staying organized and prioritizing self-care are crucial for your well-being and success as a multi-passionate visionary entrepreneur.\n\n### Time Management\n\nDevelop effective time management strategies to balance your various pursuits. Prioritize tasks, set boundaries, and allocate dedicated time for each of your passions. This will help you stay focused and prevent feeling overwhelmed by the multitude of projects on your plate.\n\n### Self-Care\n\nTaking care of yourself is essential when juggling multiple passions. Make time for self-care activities that recharge you, whether it's exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones. A well-nourished mind and body will help you sustain the energy and creativity needed to thrive as a multi-passionate visionary entrepreneur.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEmbracing your multi-passionate nature and pursuing your entrepreneurial vision can be an incredibly rewarding journey. By embracing all of your passions, cultivating a growth mindset, seeking support and collaboration, and staying organized, you can turn your diverse interests into a successful business or career. Remember, it's okay to be multi-passionate, and your unique perspective and skills have the power to make a meaningful impact on the world. \n\nKeep pushing forward, stay true to your vision, and don't be afraid to let your passions guide you to success!",

        "human_post": "# How to Handle Cryptocurrency Market Volatility\n\nHey there, crypto enthusiasts! \ud83d\ude42\n\nIf you\u2019ve been involved in the world of cryptocurrency for any amount of time, you know that volatility is just part of the game. The market can swing wildly, leaving investors feeling uncertain and anxious. But fear not! With the right strategies and mindset, you can navigate through the storm and come out ahead. In this post, we\u2019ll explore some tips on how to handle cryptocurrency market volatility like a pro.\n\n## Understanding Volatility \n\nFirst things first, let\u2019s talk about what volatility really means in the context of cryptocurrency. Essentially, it refers to the degree of variation in trading price over time. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their extreme volatility, with prices often experiencing rapid and significant fluctuations. This can be attributed to a variety of factors including market demand, regulatory news, technological developments, and overall market sentiment.\n\n## Stay Informed, Not Influenced\n\n1. **Keep Up with News**: Stay informed about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency space. Be aware of any regulatory announcements, technological advancements, or major partnerships within the industry. This information can give you valuable insights into potential market movements.\n\n2. **Avoid Impulsive Decisions**: It\u2019s easy to get swayed by the noise in the market, especially during times of intense volatility. Remember to base your decisions on thorough research and analysis, rather than reacting impulsively to every price swing.\n\n## Diversify Your Portfolio\n\n1. **Spread Your Risk**: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, consider diversifying your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies. This can help mitigate the impact of volatility on your overall investment.\n\n2. **Explore Stablecoins**: Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to stablecoins, which are designed to minimize price volatility by being pegged to a stable asset such as the US dollar.\n\n## Risk Management\n\n1. **Set Stop-Loss Orders**: Consider using stop-loss orders to automatically sell a cryptocurrency when it reaches a certain price. This can help limit potential losses during sudden downturns.\n\n2. **Allocate Responsibly**: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets can be highly unpredictable, so it\u2019s important to be mindful of the risks involved and not overextend yourself.\n\n## Long-Term Perspective\n\n1. **HODL Mentality**: In the face of volatility, it\u2019s important to maintain a long-term perspective. Instead of fixating on short-term price movements, focus on the underlying technology and fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you believe in.\n\n2. **Embrace the Dips**: Volatility can create buying opportunities for those with a long-term outlook. Consider using market downturns to accumulate more of your favorite cryptocurrencies at a discounted price.\n\n## Seek Professional Guidance\n\n1. **Consult Experts**: If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by market volatility, seek advice from experienced professionals or financial advisors who specialize in cryptocurrency investments. Their expertise can provide valuable perspective and guidance.\n\n2. **Join Communities**: Engage with like-minded individuals in cryptocurrency communities and forums. Sharing insights and experiences with others can help you navigate through volatile market conditions with more confidence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNavigating through cryptocurrency market volatility requires a combination of knowledge, emotional resilience, and strategic decision-making. By staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, practicing risk management, maintaining a long-term perspective, and seeking expert guidance when needed, you can position yourself for success in the tumultuous world of cryptocurrency trading. Remember, volatility is just part of the journey \u2013 embrace it, learn from it, and keep moving forward towards your investment goals.\n\nSo, hang in there, keep learning, and may your crypto journey be filled with fruitful gains and invaluable experiences!",

In addition, you will know how to handle the market volatility in your own business. Take a seat, a pen and a paper and let's dive in!\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nVolatility is a measure that indicates the frequency and intensity of fluctuations in the price of an asset in a given period of time.\nIf you understand concepts such as volatility and risk, you can better estimate the possibilities of losses and gains.\nTo make a profit in the short term it is necessary to count on the fluctuation in prices. Therefore, less volatile assets offer less possibilities for gains.\nThere is no rule or magic formula.\nRemember: Volatility and risk tend to go together.\nFor as long as the stock market has been in place, people have been investing.\nStay focused on your personal investment strategy and consider if your beliefs hold true with the market shifts.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nWhat I want you to think about [02:32]\nPowerful practical examples that will help you [10:29]\nWhat are you currently concerned about right now?

        "human_post": "# How to Handle Market Volatility\n\nHey there, \n\nAre you feeling a bit anxious about the ups and downs of the stock market lately? \n\nDon't worry, you're not alone. Market volatility can be unsettling, but it's a natural part of investing. While it's impossible to predict when the market will go up or down, there are strategies you can use to navigate through turbulent times with confidence. \n\nLet's dive into some actionable steps to help you handle market volatility like a pro!\n\n## Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed\n\nIt's key  to stay updated on market news and trends, but be mindful of how much information you're consuming. Always checking stock prices and reacting to every headline can lead to emotional decision-making, which may not be in your best interest. Instead, set aside specific times to review market updates from reliable sources, and focus on the long-term outlook of your investments.\n\n## Diversify Your Portfolio\n\nOne of the most effective ways to mitigate the impact of market volatility is to diversify your portfolio. Spreading your investments across different asset classes, industries, and geographical regions can help reduce overall risk. When one area of the market underperforms, other areas may hold steady or perform well, providing a buffer against potential losses.\n\n## Keep a Long-Term Perspective\n\nDuring periods of market volatility, it's crucial to maintain a long-term perspective. Remember that investing is a marathon, not a sprint. Market fluctuations, while unsettling in the short term, have historically been smoothed out over time. Stay focused on your investment goals and the reasons behind your initial investment decisions. Chances are, they haven't changed just because the market is experiencing some turbulence.\n\n## Review Your Investment Strategy\n\nMarket volatility can serve as a reminder to review your investment strategy. Take the time to assess your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon. If your circumstances or outlook have changed, it may be a good opportunity to rebalance your portfolio or make adjustments to ensure it remains aligned with your objectives.\n\n## Avoid Emotional Decision-Making\n\nEmotions can run high when the market is unpredictable, leading to impulsive decisions that may not align with your long-term goals. Avoid making drastic changes to your investment strategy based on fear or anxiety. Instead, lean on your research, analysis, and the advice of a financial professional to make informed decisions.\n\n## Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging\n\nDollar-cost averaging is a strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. This approach can help smooth out the impact of market volatility. By buying more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high, you may improve the average cost of your investments over time.\n\n## Revisit Your Emergency Fund\n\nHaving a solid emergency fund in place can provide a sense of security during periods of market volatility. Make sure you have enough cash reserves to cover any unexpected expenses or to meet your financial obligations without having to liquidate your investments during a downturn.\n\n## Seek Professional Guidance\n\nIf you find market volatility particularly overwhelming or if you're unsure about how it may impact your investments, consider seeking guidance from a qualified financial advisor. They can provide personalized insights and help you navigate through turbulent market conditions based on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals.\n\n## Remember the Power of Patience\n\nFinally, remember that patience is a virtue when it comes to investing. Market volatility can test your resolve, but staying patient and disciplined can lead to more favorable outcomes over time. Keep in mind that market downturns have historically been followed by recoveries, and maintaining a steady course can position you to benefit from the market's eventual rebound.\n\nSo, if you're feeling jittery about the market's twists and turns, take a deep breath, and remember that volatility is a normal part of the investing journey. By staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, keeping a long-term perspective, and seeking professional guidance when needed, you can navigate through market volatility with confidence and resilience. Stick to your plan, stay focused on your goals, and trust in the power of time to weather the storm.\n\nStay focused. Stay resilient. You've got this! \ud83d\ude80",

        "human_post": "# 4 Key Questions to Ask When Investing\n\nAre you considering dipping your toes into the world of investing? \n\nWhether you're a seasoned investor or just starting out, it's important to ask the right questions before diving in. Investing can be daunting, but with the right knowledge and guidance, it can also be immensely rewarding. Here are four key questions to ask yourself when considering an investment opportunity.\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3. What are my investment goals?\n\nBefore making any investment, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of what you hope to achieve. Your investment goals will shape the entire investment process, from the type of assets you invest in to your risk tolerance. Ask yourself:\n\n- What am I investing for? Retirement, a new home, education, or wealth accumulation?\n- What is my time horizon? Am I looking for short-term gains or long-term growth?\n- How much risk am I comfortable taking on to achieve my goals?\n\nUnderstanding your investment goals will help you make informed decisions and stay focused on what truly matters to you.\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3. What is my risk tolerance?\n\nEvery investment comes with a certain level of risk. Understanding your risk tolerance is key to building a portfolio that aligns with your comfort level. Consider the following:\n\n- How would I react to a sudden drop in the value of my investments?\n- Am I willing to take on more risk in pursuit of potentially higher returns?\n- What is my current financial situation, and how does it affect my risk tolerance?\n\nBeing honest with yourself about your risk tolerance will help you avoid making impulsive decisions based on market fluctuations and stay committed to your long-term investment strategy.\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3. What investment vehicle is right for me?\n\nWith so many investment options available, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one. Whether it's stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or real estate, each investment vehicle has its own characteristics and potential benefits. Consider the following:\n\n- What is my level of investment knowledge and experience with different asset classes?\n- What is the potential return and risk associated with each investment option?\n- How does each investment align with my overall financial goals and risk tolerance?\n\nChoosing the right investment vehicle requires careful consideration and often benefits from the advice of a financial advisor who can help tailor your investments to your unique circumstances.\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3. What are the costs and fees associated with the investment?\n\nInvesting isn't just about potential returns; it also involves costs and fees that can impact your overall investment performance. Before committing to any investment, be sure to inquire about:\n\n- What are the upfront costs of purchasing the investment?\n- Are there ongoing management fees or maintenance costs?\n- How do these costs impact the overall return potential of the investment?\n\nUnderstanding the costs associated with an investment will help you make informed decisions and avoid any unpleasant surprises down the line.\n\nIn conclusion, investing can be an empowering way to grow your wealth and work towards your financial goals. By asking yourself these four key questions, you can gain clarity on your objectives, risk tolerance, investment options, and associated costs. Armed with this knowledge, you'll be better equipped to make sound investment decisions that align with your unique financial journey. Remember, investing is a journey, not a race, so take the time to educate yourself and seek professional guidance if needed. \n\nHappy investing!",

        "human_post": "# The Most Profitable Types of Clients Every Business Needs\n\nWhen it comes to building a successful business, one of the key elements is having a steady stream of profitable clients. These clients not only provide revenue, but they can also lead to valuable referrals and long-term relationships. \n\n- But what exactly makes a client profitable? \n- And how can you attract more of them to your business? \n\nLet\u2019s dive into the most profitable types of clients every business needs and how you can attract them.\n\n## Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs)\n\nSMBs are the backbone of many economies around the world, and they can be incredibly lucrative clients for your business. These clients often value personalized attention and are willing to pay a premium for tailored solutions. By providing excellent customer service and customized offerings, you can build strong and lasting relationships with SMBs. Additionally, satisfied SMB clients are more likely to refer other businesses to your services, further expanding your client base.\n\n## High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)\n\nHNWIs are individuals with significant financial resources and can be a goldmine for many businesses. Whether you\u2019re in finance, real estate, or luxury goods, building relationships with HNWIs can lead to substantial revenue opportunities. These clients often value exclusivity, personalized service, and high-quality products or services. By catering to their specific needs and providing a VIP experience, you can attract and retain HNWIs as long-term, lucrative clients.\n\n## Repeat Customers\n\nRepeat customers are arguably the most profitable type of clients for any business. Not only do they provide a consistent source of revenue, but they also require less marketing and sales effort to retain. By providing exceptional products and services, excellent customer support, and loyalty programs, you can encourage repeat business and turn one-time buyers into loyal, long-term clients. Additionally, satisfied repeat customers are more likely to refer others to your business, further expanding your customer base.\n\n## Corporate Clients\n\nSecuring corporate clients can be a game-changer for many businesses, especially in B2B industries. Corporate clients often have larger budgets, longer-term contracts, and the potential for high-volume sales. By understanding their specific needs, offering competitive pricing, and demonstrating a track record of success, you can position your business as a valuable partner for corporate clients. Landing a few key corporate clients can provide stability and significant revenue for your business.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAttracting profitable clients is essential for the growth and success of any business. By focusing on small and medium-sized businesses, high-net-worth individuals, repeat customers, and corporate clients, you can diversify your client base and create a solid foundation for long-term profitability. Remember, the key to attracting these types of clients lies in understanding their unique needs and providing exceptional value and service. \n\nBy doing so, you can cultivate strong, mutually beneficial relationships that will fuel your business\u2019s growth for years to come!",

        "human_post": "# 7\ufe0f\u20e3 Income Streams to Increase Recurring Revenues\n\nAre you tired of constantly worrying about your monthly income? \n\nIt's time to take control and create multiple income streams that can provide you with recurring revenues. Diversifying your income can bring stability and security, and it also opens up opportunities for growth and expansion. \n\nHere are 7 income streams that you can explore to increase your recurring revenues:\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3. Freelancing or Consulting Services\n\nDo you have a special skill or expertise that others could benefit from?\n\nOffer your services as a freelancer or consultant. Whether it's graphic design, writing, marketing, or IT consulting, there are countless opportunities to use your skills to earn extra income. Websites like Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn can help you connect with potential clients and build a steady stream of recurring revenue.\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3. Create and Sell Digital Products\n\nTake advantage of the digital age by creating and selling digital products such as ebooks, online courses, stock photography, software, or apps. Once you've created the product, you can sell it repeatedly without incurring additional production costs. Platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, Udemy, and Shopify make it easy to get started and reach a wide audience.\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3. Affiliate Marketing\n\nAffiliate marketing allows you to earn commissions by promoting other people's products or services. Join affiliate programs related to your niche and promote products through your blog, social media, or email marketing. When people make a purchase through your unique affiliate link, you earn a commission. This can be a great way to generate passive income and build a steady stream of recurring revenue.\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3. Rental Income\n\nIf you have extra space in your home or property, consider renting it out on platforms like Airbnb or VRBO. You can also invest in rental properties that can provide you with regular rental income. Rental income can be a lucrative source of recurring revenue, and it allows you to leverage your existing assets to generate additional income.\n\n## 5\ufe0f\u20e3. Membership or Subscription Programs\n\nCreate a membership or subscription program for your audience to access exclusive content, services, or products on a recurring basis. Whether it's a monthly coaching program, a subscription box service, or a premium content membership, offering a subscription-based model can help you earn consistent, predictable income from your loyal customers.\n\n## 6\ufe0f\u20e3. Dividend-Paying Stocks and Investments\n\nInvesting in dividend-paying stocks and other income-generating investments can provide you with a steady stream of passive income. By building a well-diversified investment portfolio, you can benefit from regular dividend payments and potential capital appreciation over time. Consider working with a financial advisor to explore investment opportunities that align with your financial goals.\n\n## 7\ufe0f\u20e3. Create a Digital Media Channel\n\nStart a blog, YouTube channel, podcast, or online community to create and share valuable content with your audience. As your digital media channel grows, you can monetize it through advertising, sponsorships, merchandise sales, and premium content. Building a loyal and engaged audience can lead to a consistent stream of recurring revenue from your digital media platform.\n\nCreating multiple income streams takes time, effort, and dedication, but it can provide you with the financial stability and flexibility you desire. By diversifying your income sources, you can reduce the risk of relying on a single source of income and open up new opportunities for growth and success. \n\nTake the first step towards increasing your recurring revenues today and start exploring these income streams to create a more secure and prosperous future for yourself!",

        "human_post": "# Shy Introvert to Sales Superstar! (Feat. Li Min Huang)\n\nDo you ever feel like your natural shyness is holding you back in your career? \n\nDo you struggle with the idea of being a successful salesperson because you consider yourself an introvert? \n\nWell, we've got good news for you!\n\nLi Min Huang, an introverted sales professional, is here to show you that it's possible to overcome your shyness and thrive in the world of sales. Let's take a look at Li Min's journey from a shy introvert to a sales superstar, and learn from her experiences and tips along the way.\n\n## Embracing Introversion\n\nBeing an introvert doesn't mean you can't succeed in sales. In fact, many successful salespeople identify as introverts! Li Min Huang is a living example of how introverts can excel in the world of sales. She first struggled with the idea of putting herself out there and approaching potential clients. However, she soon realized that her introverted nature could actually be an advantage in sales.\n\n### Understanding Your Strengths\n\nIntroverts are often great listeners and observers. Li Min realized that her ability to listen attentively to her clients and pick up on subtle cues gave her a unique edge in understanding their needs and building stronger relationships. She turned her introverted qualities into strengths, using them to connect with her clients on a deeper level and gain their trust.\n\n## Overcoming Challenges\n\nOf course, transitioning from a shy introvert to a successful salesperson isn't without its challenges. Li Min faced many hurdles along the way, but she refused to let her shyness hold her back.\n\n### Stepping Out of Your Comfort Zone\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles for introverts in sales is stepping out of their comfort zone. Li Min had to push herself to engage in networking events, make cold calls, and deliver presentations. It wasn't easy, but she gradually became more comfortable with these activities by taking small, manageable steps and reminding herself of the value she could provide to her clients.\n\n## Developing Confidence\n\nConfidence is key in sales, and it can be especially challenging for introverts to project confidence in their interactions. Li Min found that building confidence was crucial to her success, and she worked on it diligently.\n\n### Building a Support System\n\nSurrounding herself with a supportive network of colleagues and mentors was instrumental in Li Min's journey. Having people who believed in her and provided encouragement helped her gain the confidence to take on new challenges and grow in her role.\n\n## Success Tips for Introverted Salespeople\n\nNow that Li Min has conquered her shyness and flourished in sales, she has some invaluable tips to share with other introverts who are aspiring to excel in the field.\n\n### Play to Your Strengths\n\nDon't try to change who you are. Instead, embrace your natural strengths as an introvert and use them to your advantage in building relationships and making genuine connections with your clients.\n\n### Practice Self-Care\n\nTaking care of your mental and emotional well-being is crucial, especially as an introvert in a high-energy, social profession. Make sure to carve out time for alone time to recharge and rejuvenate.\n\n### Continuous Learning\n\nNever stop learning and honing your skills. Seek out training opportunities and resources that can help you improve as a salesperson. The more knowledge and expertise you have, the more confident you'll feel in your abilities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLi Min Huang's journey from a shy introvert to a sales superstar is an inspiring testament to the fact that introverts can thrive in sales. By embracing her introversion, stepping out of her comfort zone, building confidence, and playing to her strengths, Li Min has achieved remarkable success in the world of sales. So if you're an introvert contemplating a career in sales, remember that it's absolutely possible to excel in this field. \n\nWith the right mindset, determination, and the tips shared by Li Min, you too can become a sales superstar!",

This question has come up a ton in conversations that I've been having with clients. More than two years ago, at the start of the pandemic I thought it might rock us into a recession. As we open back up, some questions are bubbling up:\n\nHow do we sell?\nWhat do we do?\nWhat\u2019s appropriate?\nHow do we thrive and how do we continue to do business in a way that is authentic?\n\nIf you\u2019re asking these questions, the good news is you care deeply about your clients and potential clients. Let\u2019s dive into this conversation that goes beyond selling and is about how to be in integrity and the value of the human connection. I can\u2019t wait for this conversation, come and join me!\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nRemember that you are a human being first.\nIf you reduce uncertainty for your prospective clients and customers, you are much more likely to win the sale.\nYou need to be able to stand up and lead and guide and say no, or to redirect and give solutions that are the most appropriate based on what you've just discovered.\nWhen we create too many gates to navigate through, your client is essentially going to get stuck at every point along the way. Be simple. Reduce complexity.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nWhat I want you to know in first place [02:15]\nThe 1st thing to remember to sell during uncertain time [05:22]\nThe 2nd thing to know in order to sell during uncertain time [10:54]\nThe 3rd thing to change to be able to do sales during uncertain time [14:48]\nThe 4th thing you need to learn in order to sell during uncertain time [19:52]\nThe 5th thing to know in order to sell during uncertain time [21:50]\n\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udf99 Previously Episodes Mentioned on This Episode and Powerful Resource Episodes:\n\nEpisode 10: Mastering The 7 Critical Steps Of Your Sales Process - Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep10\nEpisode 17 - Why Lead Generation Is A Sales Problem \u2013 Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep17\nEpisode 33 - 7 keys to recession proof your business \u2013 Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep33\nEpisode 34 - The 3 Different Types of Relationship Currencies \u2013 Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep34\nEpisode 40 - Critical Business Skills in A Bear Market \u2013 Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep40\n\n\u00a0\nCalling all trailblazing Powerhouse entrepreneurs!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWant to get my 1 on 1 help with a group of pioneers looking to elevate business success with your NEXT LEVEL plan?\n\u00a0\nIf you know the next level for you is a non-negotiable\u2026\nCreated in a completely aligned, customized to you way that takes into account your preferences, behaviours, existing AND new opportunities\u2026\nWithout dimming your shine, your sparkle or your brilliance\u2026\nI invite you to apply for my Accelerator program designed to help you create your impact plan to change the world, without sacrificing your life or your business results and create sustainable, scalable income (hello next 6 or 7 figures!).

        "human_post": "# Selling During Uncertain Times\n\nHi there, fellow sales professionals! \ud83d\ude00\n\nWe all know that selling can be tough, but it becomes even more challenging during uncertain times. Whether it's economic instability, a global crisis, or just general unpredictability, selling door-to-door or meeting with potential clients face-to-face can suddenly become a daunting task. \n\nBut fear not, because I'm here to share some tips and tricks to help you navigate through these uncertain times and continue to close those deals like a pro!\n\n## Understand Your Prospect's Needs and Concerns\n\nDuring uncertain times, your potential clients may have a lot on their minds. They might be worried about the future, their financial security, or the well-being of their loved ones. As a salesperson, it's crucial to be empathetic and understanding of these concerns. Take the time to listen to your prospects and truly understand their needs and pain points. Show them that you care about more than just making a sale. This will help you build trust and rapport, making it easier to guide them towards a solution that meets their needs.\n\n## Adapt Your Sales Pitch\n\nThe sales pitches that worked like a charm before may not resonate as well during uncertain times. It's important to adapt your approach to reflect the current climate. Highlight the ways in which your product or service can provide stability, security, or peace of mind. Tailor your pitch to address the specific concerns that your prospects may have during uncertain times. By doing so, you'll demonstrate that you are aware of the challenges they are facing and that you have a solution that can help.\n\n## Leverage Digital Platforms and Technology\n\nWith face-to-face meetings and in-person pitches becoming increasingly challenging, it's time to embrace digital platforms and technology to support your sales efforts. Utilize video calls, webinars, and virtual demos to showcase your offerings and connect with potential clients. Enhance your online presence through social media, email marketing, and digital advertising to reach a wider audience. By using technology, you can continue to engage with prospects and keep the sales process moving forward, even when physical interactions are limited.\n\n## Provide Value and Build Trust\n\nIn uncertain times, the value you provide to your prospects can make all the difference. Give insightful content, resources, and information that can help them navigate the challenges they are facing. Position yourself as a trusted advisor rather than just a salesperson. Share success stories and testimonials from existing clients to build credibility and inspire confidence in your offerings. When you consistently deliver value and build trust, you'll find it easier to keep the sales conversations going, even when the environment is uncertain.\n\n## Stay Positive and Persistent\n\nIt's easy to feel discouraged when faced with uncertainty, but maintaining a positive attitude is essential for sales success. Keep your energy high and your enthusiasm contagious, even if you're facing rejection or hesitation from prospects. Remember that persistence pays off. Follow up diligently, nurture leads, and stay engaged with your prospects. By demonstrating your unwavering commitment to helping them, you'll stand out as a sales professional who goes above and beyond, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSelling during uncertain times may pose its own set of challenges, but with the right mindset and approach, you can continue to excel in your sales role. By understanding your prospect's needs, adapting your pitch, leveraging technology, providing value, and staying positive and persistent, you can navigate through uncertainty and emerge as a stronger and more effective salesperson. Embrace the opportunity to connect with your prospects on a deeper level, and remember that you have the resilience and capability to thrive in any environment. Now, go out there and show the world what you're made of!\n\nAlright, that's all for now, folks. Keep hustling and keep closing those deals, even when the going gets tough. You've got this! \ud83d\ude80",

Premium is not only charging more for your offers. Premium is what you feel - the experience, not just what you see. Used incorrectly, your customers will think it\u2019s a sleazy sales strategy designed to charge more for the same old stuff. But used well? Companies that offer a premium service or product stand out from their competitors and use these offers to attract their top 1% premium clients. Today\u2019s episode we\u2019re talking about the three core elements of premium offers, whether you sell products and services, programs, educational services, consulting, or professional work. Let's dive in!\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nIt's really important that you qualify and quantify what a premium priced offer is going to look like.\nThe amount that you charge has nothing to do with who you are or how you are.\nEvery invention that you have now and forever more, is a gift.\nYour premium offer must solve a clear problem.\nThere is a higher level of care, consideration and criteria that allows premium clients to self-select. Price is only one of them. It\u2019s so much more than price alone.\nIt\u2019s important that you give what\u2019s needed in order to deliver the outcome and the results that you're promising.\nThere's almost always going to be somebody else who's going to charge more and less. The price is really irrelevant.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nThe number one question that I get [01:29]\nWhat your premium offer is really about [05:38]\nThe 1st Core Element of Premium Offers [09:42]\nA real life business example [11:05]\nThe 2nd Core Element of Premium Offers [16:01]\nSimpler is usually faster, but fast is not always good [20:02]\nThe 3rd Core Element of Premium Offers [22:29]\nWhy this is not about algorithms.

        "human_post": "# What It Takes to Create Premium Offers That Are In Demand and Sell Out Consistently\n\nAre you tired of working hard and not seeing the results you want? \n\nDo you have amazing products or services but struggle to sell them consistently? \n\nIt can be frustrating, but the good news is that there are proven strategies to create premium offers that are in high demand and sell out consistently. \n\nIf you're ready to take your business to the next level, keep reading to learn what it takes to achieve this kind of success.\n\n## Understanding Your Ideal Customer\n\nThe first step in creating premium offers that sell out consistently is to thoroughly understand your ideal customer. This means going beyond basic demographic information and really digging deep to understand their desires, pain points, and aspirations. Ask yourself:\n\n- What are their biggest challenges or frustrations?\n- What do they dream about achieving? \ud83d\udcad\n- How can my product or service help them get there?\n\nWhen you truly understand your ideal customer, you can tailor your offers to meet their specific needs and create an irresistible opportunity they can't resist.\n\n## Crafting Irresistible Offers\n\nOnce you have a deep understanding of your ideal customer, it's time to craft irresistible offers that speak directly to them. This goes beyond just listing the features of your product or service \u2013 it's about highlighting the transformation it can create in their lives. Consider the following:\n\n- What specific problem does your offer solve for your ideal customer?\n- How does it make their life easier, better, or more enjoyable?\n- What makes your offer unique and different from anything else on the market?\n\nBy clearly articulating the value and benefits of your offer, you can make it irresistible to your ideal customer and stand out in a crowded marketplace.\n\n## Communicating Your Value Effectively\n\nOnce you have crafted your premium offer, the next step is to communicate its value effectively. This means creating compelling sales copy, engaging visuals, and persuasive messaging that resonates with your ideal customer. Consider the following:\n\n- How can you tell a story that showcases the transformation your offer provides?\n- What emotional triggers can you use to connect with your ideal customer?\n- What objections or doubts might your ideal customer have, and how can you address them effectively?\n\nBy effectively communicating the value of your premium offer, you can build excitement and anticipation that drives consistent sales.\n\n## Building Trust and Credibility\n\nIn today's competitive market, building trust and credibility is essential for selling out premium offers consistently. This means delivering on your promises, providing exceptional customer service, and showcasing social proof. Consider the following:\n\n- How can you demonstrate the results and success stories of past customers?\n- What guarantees or assurances can you provide to mitigate any risk for your ideal customer?\n- How can you position yourself as an authority or expert in your niche?\n\nBy building trust and credibility, you can instill confidence in your ideal customer and make it easy for them to say \"yes\" to your premium offers.\n\n## Creating Scarcity and Urgency\n\nFinally, creating scarcity and urgency can be the key to selling out your premium offers consistently. By leveraging limited-time promotions, exclusive bonuses, or limited quantities, you can create a sense of urgency that compels your ideal customer to take action. Consider the following:\n\n- How can you create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) around your offer?\n- What exclusive bonuses or incentives can you offer to early adopters or loyal customers?\n- How can you effectively communicate the limited availability of your premium offer without being pushy or inauthentic?\n\nBy creating scarcity and urgency, you can create a buying frenzy that consistently sells out your premium offers.\n\nIn conclusion, creating premium offers that are in demand and sell out consistently requires a deep understanding of your ideal customer, crafting irresistible offers, communicating your value effectively, building trust and credibility, and creating scarcity and urgency. By implementing these strategies, you can take your business to new heights and achieve the success you've always dreamed of. \n\nIt's time to stop settling for mediocrity and start creating the kind of premium offers that will have customers lining up to buy from you.",

        "human_post": "# Biggest Blocks to Creating Consistent Income\n\nAre you struggling to make a steady income from your business or job? \n\nYou're not alone. Many people face challenges when it comes to creating consistent income. These roadblocks can seem insurmountable, but with the right strategies and mindset, you can break through and start earning the income you desire.\n\n## Lack of Clarity\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles to creating consistent income is a lack of clarity. Not being clear about your goals, target audience, or the value you provide can lead to a scattered approach that doesn't yield the results you want.\n\n### Solution:\n- Take the time to define your goals and objectives clearly. Who do you want to serve? \n- What problem do you want to solve? \n- What value do you offer? \n- When you have a clear understanding of these elements, you can tailor your efforts to attract the right opportunities and income streams.\n\n## Inconsistent Marketing Efforts\n\nInconsistency in your marketing efforts can also hinder your ability to generate consistent income. If you're not regularly reaching out to potential clients or customers, you may experience fluctuations in your income.\n\n### Solution:\nCreate a marketing plan and schedule regular outreach efforts. This could include social media posts, email marketing, networking events, or other forms of promotion. By maintaining consistent marketing efforts, you can keep your business or career on the radar of potential income sources.\n\n## Fear of Selling\n\nMany people struggle with a fear of selling. Whether it's a product, service, or even themselves in a job interview, the fear of rejection can prevent you from actively seeking out income opportunities.\n\n### Solution:\nShift your mindset from \"selling\" to \"serving.\" Instead of focusing on the transaction, focus on how your offering can truly benefit the person on the other end. When you approach income opportunities from a place of service and value, it becomes easier to overcome the fear of selling.\n\n## Limiting Beliefs\n\nLimiting beliefs about money, success, or your own capabilities can create mental barriers that hold you back from achieving consistent income.\n\n### Solution:\nWork on reprogramming your mindset. Replace negative beliefs with empowering affirmations and visualizations. Surround yourself with positive influences, whether it's through books, podcasts, or supportive communities. Over time, you can reshape your beliefs to be more conducive to attracting consistent income.\n\n## Lack of Diversification\n\nRelying too heavily on a single income source can leave you vulnerable to fluctuations and instability.\n\n### Solution:\nExplore multiple income streams. This could mean offering diverse services or products within your business, pursuing side gigs, or investing in passive income opportunities. Diversifying your income sources can provide a safety net and contribute to more consistent overall earnings.\n\n## Procrastination and Lack of Action\n\nProcrastination and a lack of action can also be major obstacles to creating consistent income. Waiting for the \"perfect\" moment or overthinking can lead to missed opportunities.\n\n### Solution:\nTake imperfect action. Instead of waiting for everything to be flawless, start taking steps toward your income goals. Progress is often more important than perfection. By consistently taking action, you can build momentum and create a more steady flow of income.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCreating consistent income is a goal that many hope to achieve. By addressing these common blocks and implementing the suggested solutions, you can overcome the challenges and create a more stable financial foundation. It's essential to approach these obstacles with determination and a willingness to adapt. \n\nWith persistence and the right strategies, you can pave the way for a more consistent and reliable income!!",

        "human_post": "# How to Attract High Paying Clients without Being on Social Media Constantly\n\nAre you tired of feeling like you have to constantly be on social media just to attract high paying clients for your business? \n\nIt can be draining to keep up with the ever-changing algorithms and trends, not to mention the endless scrolling and engagement that can take up so much of your time. The good news is that there are other effective ways to attract high paying clients without being glued to social media 24/7. \n\nIn this blog post, I'll share proven strategies that will help you connect with quality clients and grow your business without the constant social media hustle.\n\n## Focus on Building Relationships\n\nBuilding strong relationships is key to attracting high paying clients. Instead of spreading yourself thin across multiple social media platforms, focus on creating genuine connections with your target audience. Here's how:\n\n### Networking Events and Conferences\nAttending industry-specific networking events and conferences can open doors to valuable connections and potential high paying clients. Engage in meaningful conversations, exchange business cards, and follow up with personalized messages to nurture those relationships.\n\n### Collaborate with Industry Leaders\nPartnering with established industry leaders can help you gain access to their network and audience. Consider co-hosting webinars, workshops, or events to showcase your expertise and attract high paying clients who value your association with the influencer.\n\n## Leverage Content Marketing\n\nInstead of relying solely on social media for content distribution, consider diversifying your content marketing strategy to reach high paying clients through other channels.\n\n### Start a Blog\nCreating valuable, informative content on a blog can establish you as an authority in your industry. High paying clients are more likely to engage with your content and see you as a trusted advisor when they find insightful, well-written articles that address their pain points.\n\n### Guest Posting\nWriting guest posts for reputable industry publications or websites can expose your expertise to a wider audience and drive high paying clients to your business. Look for platforms where your ideal clients are likely to frequent and offer to share your expertise through guest contributions.\n\n## Optimize Your Website for Search Engines\n\nHaving a strong online presence is crucial for attracting high paying clients. Instead of relying solely on social media for visibility, prioritize optimizing your website for search engines to attract quality leads.\n\n### SEO-Optimized Content\nCreating SEO-optimized content on your website can help you rank higher in search engine results, making it easier for high paying clients to find you when they're actively looking for solutions to their challenges.\n\n### Targeted Landing Pages\nDesigning targeted landing pages for specific services or products can help you capture the attention of high paying clients who are ready to take action. A clear call-to-action and compelling messaging can entice quality leads to reach out to you directly.\n\n## Build a Referral Network\n\nWord-of-mouth referrals continue to be a powerful way to attract high paying clients. Instead of constantly promoting yourself on social media, prioritize building a referral network that consistently brings quality leads to your business.\n\n### Nurture Existing Relationships\nStay in touch with past clients, colleagues, and industry contacts to nurture your relationships. A simple follow-up email or occasional check-in can keep you top of mind when they come across high paying clients in need of your expertise.\n\n### Offer Incentives for Referrals\nCreate a referral program that rewards clients, partners, and even employees for referring high paying clients to your business. Incentives can motivate others to actively promote your services to their network, leading to a steady stream of quality leads.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAttracting high paying clients doesn't have to depend solely on a constant presence on social media. By focusing on building relationships, leveraging content marketing, optimizing your website for search engines, and building a strong referral network, you can attract quality clients and grow your business without the need to be on social media constantly. It's all about creating genuine connections, delivering valuable content, and nurturing long-term relationships that ultimately lead to sustainable business growth. \n\nSo, take a step back from the social media frenzy, and explore these alternative strategies to attract high paying clients and take your business to the next level. \ud83d\udcc8",

        "human_post": "# Turning Problems into Opportunities with Effective Customer Service\n\nAre you tired of seeing customer complaints as nothing but a headache? \n\nIt's time to shift your perspective and start viewing them as opportunities to shine. Effective customer service can turn a negative experience into a positive one and create loyal customers for life. Let's explore how to do this.\n\n## Understanding the Power of Effective Customer Service\n\n### Acknowledge the Problem\nThe first step in turning a problem into an opportunity is to acknowledge the issue at hand. Customers want to feel heard and understood, so take the time to listen to their concerns and validate their feelings. This simple act can go a long way in diffusing the situation and building rapport.\n\n### Take Responsibility\nEven if the problem wasn't directly caused by your business, taking responsibility for finding a solution shows your commitment to customer satisfaction. Avoiding blame and focusing on resolution can help rebuild trust and turn a negative experience around.\n\n## Turning Problems into Opportunities\n\n### Personalized Solutions\nInstead of providing generic responses, take the time to offer personalized solutions to address the customer's specific issue. By tailoring your approach to each situation, you show that you genuinely care about making things right.\n\n### Go Above and Beyond\nDon't just meet the customer's expectations\u2014exceed them. Whether it's offering a freebie, a discount on their next purchase, or simply providing extra support, going the extra mile demonstrates your dedication to excellent customer service.\n\n### Gather Feedback\nUse the opportunity to gather valuable feedback from the customer. What could have been done differently? How can you improve your products or services? This information is gold for refining your business and preventing similar issues in the future.\n\n## The Benefits of Effective Customer Service\n\n### Customer Retention\nWhen customers feel valued and supported, they are more likely to remain loyal to your brand. By turning a negative experience into a positive one, you have the chance to win back their trust and keep them coming back for more.\n\n### Positive Word of Mouth\nSatisfied customers will share their positive experiences with others. This word-of-mouth marketing can be incredibly powerful in attracting new customers to your business. Turning a problem into an opportunity not only benefits the customer involved but also has the potential to enhance your reputation.\n\n### Personal Growth\nDealing with challenging situations can be a learning opportunity for your team. Encourage a growth mindset and use each experience to refine your customer service approach. Over time, you'll become more adept at handling issues with grace and expertise.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEffective customer service has the power to transform problems into opportunities. By acknowledging and addressing customer concerns, providing personalized solutions, and going above and beyond, you can create positive outcomes that benefit both your customers and your business. Embracing these opportunities not only strengthens customer relationships but also sets you apart as a brand that truly cares about its patrons. \n\nSo, the next time you're faced with a customer complaint, see it as a chance to shine, learn, and grow! \ud83d\ude01",

This is something I\u2019ve been shouting from the rooftops from the very beginning of my business. Properly qualifying leads will make a complete difference in the return on investment of your business, because through it, we separate the wheat from the tare.\nYou have to be able to separate leads that are interested in your product or service, nurturing those who aren\u2019t ready by educating them, to then qualify them and make them future customers. From the moment you capture a lead, you will be able to know which stage of the buying journey they are in, as well as their interests and needs. This is done throughout the stages of the sales funnel. There is a lot behind lead generation that we are going to dive more into today.

That is the conversion process.\nIf you continue to focus on quantity over quality, you will be burnt out and exhausted.\nFocusing on quality can often lead to an overflow of people coming into the different types of products and services and programs that you want in a variety of ways, sometimes very unexpected.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nReferrals [04:09]\nThree things that will keep you stop you\u00a0 from attracting more quality leads [08:24]\nA reminder of part one [13:28]\nWhat happens when you are specific [16:38]\nWhat causes frustration [21:35]\nThere is a strategic way [24:40]\nThinking through how you convert leads to say yes [28:59]\n\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udf99 Previously Episodes Mentioned on This Episode and Powerful Resource Episodes:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Episode 10: Mastering The 7 Critical Steps Of Your Sales Process - Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep10\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Episode 17 - Why Lead Generation Is A Sales Problem \u2013 Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep17\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Episode 78 - How to Know When You Need to Hire a Sales Team Member \u2013 Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep78\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Episode 81 - 5 Strategies to Get More Clients Even With A Tiny List Audience Or Following \u2013 Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep81\n\n\u00a0\nFind out the exact path I took to achieve my first 6 figure success online in 6 months\u2026\nYou don\u2019t need to be a marketing or sales expert to make money and achieve your first 6 figures.

        "human_post": "# Your Lead Generation Problem is Not a Lack of Leads (Part 2)\n\nWelcome back to the second part of our discussion on lead generation! \n\nIn the first part, we talked about how your lead generation problem might not actually be a lack of leads, but rather a lack of effective lead nurturing and conversion strategies. Today, we're going to dive deeper into this topic and explore some key aspects of lead nurturing that you can focus on to improve your lead generation results.\n\n## Understanding Your Ideal Customer\n\nOne of the most key elements of successful lead nurturing is having a deep understanding of who your ideal customer is. This goes beyond basic demographic information and requires you to really get to know your target audience on a personal level. Understanding their pain points, challenges, goals, and aspirations will allow you to tailor your messaging and content to resonate with them on a deeper level.\n\n### Empathy and Personalization\n\nEmpathy is critical when it comes to connecting with your leads. Show them that you understand their struggles and that you genuinely want to help them find a solution. Personalization is also incredibly important. Generic, one-size-fits-all messages simply won't cut it in today's hyper-personalized marketing landscape. Use data and insights to personalize your interactions with leads and make them feel seen and understood.\n\n## Building Trust and Credibility\n\nIn the digital age, where skepticism runs high and trust is hard to come by, building trust and credibility with your leads is crucial. People are more likely to do business with companies they trust, so it's essential to focus on nurturing this trust throughout the lead nurturing process.\n\n### Content Marketing\n\nContent marketing plays a significant role in building trust and credibility. By creating valuable, educational content that addresses your leads' pain points and provides solutions, you position yourself as a trusted advisor rather than just a salesperson. This can significantly influence the way leads perceive your brand and ultimately lead to higher conversion rates.\n\n### Social Proof and Testimonials\n\nSocial proof, such as customer testimonials, case studies, and reviews, can also help build trust with your leads. Seeing proof that others have had a positive experience with your product or service can alleviate doubts and create a sense of security for potential customers.\n\n## Effective Communication and Relationship Building\n\nEffective communication and relationship building are at the heart of successful lead nurturing. It's essential to maintain consistent and meaningful interactions with your leads to keep them engaged and moving through the sales funnel.\n\n### Omnichannel Marketing\n\nUse multiple communication channels to reach your leads and engage with them where they are most comfortable. Whether it's email, social media, or in-person events, meeting your leads on their preferred platforms can help foster stronger connections.\n\n### Lead Scoring and Segmentation\n\nNot all leads are created equal, and treating them as such can lead to missed opportunities. Implement lead scoring and segmentation strategies to identify high-potential leads and tailor your communication and messaging accordingly. This personalized approach can significantly boost the effectiveness of your lead nurturing efforts.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo summarize, your lead generation problem is often not a lack of leads but rather a lack of effective lead nurturing strategies. By focusing on understanding your ideal customer, building trust and credibility, and fostering effective communication and relationship building, you can transform your lead generation efforts and drive better results. Remember, successful lead nurturing is about creating meaningful connections and providing value every step of the way. \n\nSo, go ahead, implement these strategies, and watch your leads transform into loyal customers.

Leads, unlike prospects, are contacts who have shown interest in some type of product or service.

It feels like no matter how hard you try, you just can't seem to generate enough leads to grow your business. But here's the thing \u2013 the problem might not actually be a lack of leads. In this two-part series, we're going to explore why your lead generation problem might be something else entirely, and how you can fix it.\n\n## Part 1: It's Not About Quantity, It's About Quality\n\n### Understanding Your Ideal Customer\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about your ideal customer. \n\n- Do you know who they are? \n- What are their pain points, desires, and needs? \n\nUnderstanding your ideal customer is critical as it allows you to tailor your lead generation efforts to attract the right people \u2013 those who are most likely to convert into paying customers. If you're casting a wide net and trying to attract everyone, you're going to waste time and resources on leads that will never convert.\n\n### The Importance of Targeted Messaging\n\nOnce you've nailed down who your ideal customer is, the next step is to create targeted messaging that speaks directly to them. Generic, one-size-fits-all messaging is a surefire way to blend in with the crowd and get lost in the noise. Your messaging should resonate with your ideal customer, addressing their pain points and offering a compelling solution.\n\n### Building Trust and Credibility\n\nIn today's digital age, people are bombarded with advertising everywhere they turn. To stand out and attract high-quality leads, you need to build trust and credibility. This could be through educational content, case studies, testimonials, or any other form of social proof that demonstrates your expertise and the value you provide.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, if you've been banging your head against the wall trying to generate more leads without success, it might be time to shift your focus. Instead of obsessing over the quantity of leads, start concentrating on the quality. Understand your ideal customer, tailor your messaging, and build trust and credibility \u2013 these are the keys to attracting high-quality leads that are more likely to convert. In part two of this series, we're going to dive even deeper into this topic and explore more strategies for solving your lead generation problem. \n\nStay tuned and get ready to turn your lead generation woes around! \ud83d\udc4f",

        "human_post": "# Key Bottlenecks to Scaling Sales\n\nStruggling to boost your sales? You're not alone. Many businesses face challenges when trying to increase their sales. Let's explore common bottlenecks and how to overcome them.\n\n## Ineffective Sales Processes\n\nA major hurdle is inefficient sales processes. If your process isn't streamlined, your team might struggle to close deals and turn leads into customers. Consider these:\n\n- **Lead Management**: Are you effectively nurturing and following up with leads?\n- **Sales Funnel**: Is your sales funnel designed for maximum efficiency and conversion?\n- **Sales Tools and Technology**: Are you using the best tools and technology to support your sales team?\n\n## Lack of Clear Sales Strategy and Goals\n\nWithout a clear strategy and defined goals, your team might lose focus. This can lead to inefficiency and missed opportunities. Think about:\n\n- **Defining Target Audience**: Do you clearly understand who your target customers are?\n- **Setting SMART Goals**: Are your sales goals specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound?\n- **Sales Training and Development**: Does your team have the necessary skills and training?\n\n## Underperforming Sales Team\n\nYour sales team is crucial for scaling sales. If they're not performing well, it can hinder growth. Focus on:\n\n- **Hiring the Right People**: Are the right people in the right roles?\n- **Sales Team Motivation**: Are you motivating your team effectively?\n- **Performance Management**: Are you properly measuring and managing your team's performance?\n\n## Inadequate Sales and Marketing Alignment\n\nSales and marketing need to work together seamlessly. If they don't, it can create bottlenecks. Examine:\n\n- **Communication and Collaboration**: Are your sales and marketing teams communicating and collaborating effectively?\n- **Lead Quality and Quantity**: Is your marketing generating high-quality leads for your sales team?\n- **Feedback Loop**: Is there a system for sharing insights and improving processes?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nScaling sales is challenging, but by identifying and addressing these bottlenecks, you can set your business up for success. Evaluate your sales processes, strategies, team performance, and sales-marketing alignment. Positive changes in these areas can significantly impact your ability to scale sales.\n\nRemember, scaling sales is a journey. Assess, strategize, and execute - and you'll unlock your full sales potential. Good luck!",

Lacking Confidence\n\n**Problem:** Lack of confidence in your product can create doubt in the prospect's mind.\n\n**Solution:** Believe in your product.

Telemarketing doesn\u2019t have a great reputation for sales. It may be one of the biggest reasons why you think sales can be sleazy. Chances are you\u2019ve had a telemarketer contact you. Chances are, the contact was less than thrilling. Telemarketing is promoting sales and services over the telephone. Even though you may find these conversations annoying, I\u2019m going to break down the most effective techniques telemarketers use to increase sales that you can use too. Let's dive in!\u00a0\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nThere are some tried and true principles that still apply to the world of negotiation.\nYour business is not a real business, unless it makes sales.\nSales is an energetic exchange of a conversation and a connection that you're having with somebody.\nYou don\u2019t need to spend a ton of time talking around and around in order to get the outcome and result that you want.\nWhen you are closing a deal, you actually don't close it at the end.\nObjections are really just an opportunity for clarification.\nIf you have identified the key problem and you understand the vision and they have bought into that, then there really is no need to convince somebody.\nThe flip side of every purchasing decision is that somebody has likely helped you to buy.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nSales does not have to be sleazy [00:51]\u00a0\n1st Effective Technique Telemarketers Use to Increase Sales [06:57]\nI don't recommend this for every sales situation [09:49]\n2nd Effective Technique Telemarketers Use to Increase Sales [13:10]\nWhy having a script can be great [17:03]\nThe next thing to remember [21:13]\n3rd Effective Technique Telemarketers Use to Increase Sales [21:56]\nWhat I want you to take away from this episode [22:51]\nWhere are you missing the ball?

It consists of the set of skills and knowledge of a person, a system or technology. In your business or career, expertise is often described as \"know-how\". It\u2019s the knowledge from the study of a subject and the ability to apply that knowledge. It\u2019s both the skills and competence to execute that is important. Over time that practiced application becomes your experience and increases your authority as an expert.\u00a0\nIn today's episode I will share the Top 3 Strategies to Get Paid More for Your Expertise. As a business owner, you likely want to be paid well for your skills and knowledge. After all, that's what expertise is all about, doing something with excellence. This works, even if you're brand new, never had clients before, or you\u2019re an old hat, and have tons and tons of clients, but maybe not getting paid what you believe you should be getting paid. Let's dive in!\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nStop being a generalist and start being a specialist.\nIt really is about owning your expertise.\nYou have a very specific type of skill set that\u2019s uniquely suited to a certain subset of people. That's your niche.\nThe more specialized you can go, the easier it will be for you to command top dollar prices.\nIf you can't communicate the value of what you do, it\u2019s going to be challenging for other people to communicate the value better than you.\nIs all about productizing your expertise.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nThings I don\u2019t tell to my clients [01:23]\n\u00a01st Strategy to Get Paid More for Your Expertise [02:19]\n2nd\u00a0 Strategy to Get Paid More for Your Expertise [12:17]\nThe rule that applies across all industries and across all situations[15:50]\n3rd Strategy to Get Paid More for Your Expertise [18:11]\nQuick review on the top three strategies.

First of all we need to remember that these concepts are not the same as content marketing or even social media management. These are things that I did at the very start of my business, and I continue to do them today because they can be done in less than 90 minutes a day.\n\u00a0\nThree simple strategies to master your virtual and social selling that will allow you to close more sales, make more connections and deepen the relationships that you have with potential clients and customers, as well as your existing paying clients and customers. If that sounds good, you're going to want to stick around to today's episode. Let's dive in!\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nSocial selling is really about building relationships.\nWithout building relationships, it\u2019s very difficult to sell and to sell well.\nThere is a huge opportunity. Your target market is on social media somewhere.\nYour social media platforms are designed to create connections with your ideal clients and target market.\nYour content can't be designed to talk at people.\nYour content needs to encourage people, to be interactive, to create engagement, to create conversation, to allow them to think, and to pursue an opportunity to really build a relationship with you.\nUse social listening as a way to stay top of mind with the conversations that are the most meaningful for your ideal client.\nRemember that conversions are simply about having people say yes to continuing to engage with you in the next step of the sales process.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nWhat is social selling and why is it so important?

        "human_post": "# 3 Simple Strategies to Improve Virtual and Social Selling Close Rates\n\nToday, selling online and through social media is really important for salespeople. To get better at closing deals and making sales using these methods, here are three easy strategies you can use.\n\n### Embrace Authenticity and Personalization\n\nBeing real and personal is key in online sales. Here's how to do it:\n\n#### 1. Know Your Audience\nUnderstand who you're selling to. Learn about their needs and what they're looking for. This way, you can make your messages more personal and relevant to them.\n\n#### 2. Leverage Personalized Communication\nTalk to each customer in a way that's special to them. Use their name and make your messages fit their specific needs. This shows you care and understand them.\n\n#### 3. Be Authentic and Transparent\nAlways be honest and real in your conversations. Don't push too hard or make false promises.

In today's episode you\u2019ll get simple strategies and tips to increase your rate of closed sales per proposal.

        "human_post": "# Turning 1 Client into 3 Using the 3X Effect Strategy\n\nHave you ever wondered how you can turn one satisfied client into three? It's not magic, but it does require strategy and intention. The 3X Effect Strategy is a powerful method that can help you maximize your client base and expand your business in an effective and sustainable way. In this blog post, we'll delve into the key components of the 3X Effect Strategy and how you can implement it to grow your client base exponentially.\n\n## The Power of Referrals\n\nReferrals are like gold in the world of business. When a client refers someone to your business, it's a powerful endorsement of the value you provide. The 3X Effect Strategy leverages the power of referrals to grow your client base exponentially.\n\n### Building Trust and Rapport\nThe foundation of the 3X Effect Strategy is to build strong, trusting relationships with your existing clients. When your clients trust you and feel confident in the value you provide, they are more likely to refer others to your business.\n\n### Delivering Exceptional Service\nExceeding client expectations is key to inspiring them to refer others to your business. By consistently delivering exceptional service and going above and beyond for your clients, you create a natural platform for receiving referrals.\n\n### Asking for Referrals\nMany businesses miss out on referrals simply because they don't ask for them. Implementing a structured approach to asking for referrals can significantly increase the number of referrals you receive.\n\n## The Ripple Effect\n\nOnce you've received a referral and gained a new client, the 3X Effect Strategy kicks in to maximize the potential of that new relationship.\n\n### Providing Value to New Clients\nWhen a new client comes on board, it's crucial to provide exceptional value from the outset. This not only solidifies the new client relationship but also sets the stage for potential future referrals from this new client.\n\n### Leveraging Testimonials and Case Studies\nAs you continue to provide value to your new client, it's important to capture their positive experiences through testimonials and case studies. These success stories can then be used to attract more referrals in the future.\n\n### Engaging with New Clients\nEngaging with your new clients on a regular basis builds rapport and trust, which are essential for cultivating a fertile ground for future referrals.\n\n## Nurturing the Network\n\nThe final piece of the 3X Effect Strategy is about nurturing the network of clients that you've built, to create a continuous cycle of referrals and growth.\n\n### Creating a Community\nBuilding a community of satisfied clients can be a powerful source of referrals. By fostering a sense of community among your clients, you can encourage them to refer others within the community.\n\n### Offering Incentives\nProviding incentives for referrals can further motivate your clients to refer others to your business. Whether it's a discount on future services or a special bonus, incentives can be a strong catalyst for generating referrals.\n\n### Staying Top of Mind\nConsistent communication and engagement with your network of clients can keep you at the top of their minds when they come across someone in need of your services. This can lead to ongoing referrals over time.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nThe 3X Effect Strategy is a powerful method for turning one client into three, and beyond. By focusing on building strong relationships, providing exceptional value, and nurturing your network, you can create a sustainable and scalable stream of referrals for your business. Remember, it's not just about getting referrals, but also about nurturing those relationships to create a network of satisfied clients who will continue to fuel the growth of your business.",

But this can increase the noise and make it harder to figure out what your most important thing is.\u00a0\nIf your business is not seeing the kinds of results that you want, I guarantee it's because the most important daily tasks are getting lost in the busy work.

Dive into today\u2019s episode and find out!\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nThink more about the concept of \"connection\" in your daily life and how it influences your business.\nConnection is about people.\nCustomers and clients are people. Your business serves people. Never forget that.\nThe digital market does not rely on a platform in order to work. It relies on you in order to work, which is why it is so great because you are in full control.\nMake sure you\u2019re creating opportunities for your dream clients to connect with you every single day.\nRemember you get to pick who you connect with and why you are connecting with them and how those connections can really add value.\nAlways think, \u201cHow do I create a win-win opportunity for both of us\u201d?\nThe intention of the conversation is to guide somebody into a framework or process in order to ensure that they are making the right decision for them.\nBelieving is not the only important part.\nMoney follows passion, not the other way around.\nSatisfied customers do the best advertising.\nGood work is the result of good communication.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nWhat do you need to do as a digital business owner [03:22]\nThe Triple C Framework for Business Owners \u2013 1st Step to Use in Your Business and Life [06:04]\nThe Triple C Framework for Business Owners \u2013 2nd Step to Use in Your Business and Life [13:15]\nThe Triple C Framework for Business Owners \u2013 3rd Step to Use in Your Business and Life [18:06]\nWhat A Conversion Process Needs to Look Like [19:15]\nWhat generated over hundreds of millions, (probably closer to over a billion dollars) worth of sales in 20+ years.

        "human_post": "# Preparing for a Productive and Profitable Seasonal Sale\n\nGetting ready for a seasonal sale? It's a big task, but with the right plan, you can make it a huge success. Here's how to prepare for a sale that's both profitable and enjoyable for you and your customers.\n\n## Setting Clear Goals and Objectives\n\nStart by setting clear goals for your sale. This gives you direction and helps you measure success later.\n\n### Define your sales targets\nDecide on specific sales goals, like how much money you want to make, how many items to sell, or how many new customers to get. Clear targets keep you focused.\n\n### Identify key performance indicators (KPIs)\nPick KPIs that match your sales goals. This could be things like how many people buy something (conversion rate), how much they spend (average order value), or if they come back to buy more (customer retention). Watching these KPIs helps you understand how well your sale is doing.\n\n## Planning Your Promotions and Marketing\n\nGood promotions and marketing are key to a great sale. You need to get people excited and let them know about your deals.\n\n### Create a promotional calendar\nPlan your promotions ahead of time. Make a calendar with all your different offers and campaigns. This keeps you organized and ensures you're always promoting something during the sale.\n\n### Utilize multiple marketing channels\nUse different ways to reach people, like emails, social media, ads, or working with influencers. The more people you reach, the better.\n\n## Optimizing Your Inventory and Operations\n\nMake sure you have the right products ready and can handle more orders.\n\n### Analyze past sales data\nLook at what sold well before and what customers like. This helps you stock up on the right items for the sale.\n\n### Streamline fulfillment and customer service processes\nGet ready for more orders and questions. Maybe hire extra help, extend support hours, and tell customers when they can expect their orders.\n\n## Enhancing the Customer Experience\n\nHappy customers come back and tell others about your brand. Make sure they have a great time shopping with you.\n\n### Provide personalized recommendations\nUse what you know about your customers to suggest products they might like. This can make them buy more and feel good about shopping with you.\n\n### Offer incentives for returning customers\nGive special deals or early access to people who've shopped with you before. It's a nice way to say thanks and keep them coming back.\n\n## Wrapping Up and Looking Ahead\n\nAs you get ready for your sale, remember that being prepared and focusing on your customers are the most important things. Set goals, plan your marketing, get your inventory and operations ready, and make sure customers have a great experience. It's not just about selling stuff; it's about making a lasting impression.\n\nSo, get everything set, stay focused, and get ready for a fantastic seasonal sale. Good luck, and here's to a successful event!",

But how do you plan without all the analysis paralysis that can sometimes follow? That's why we\u2019re diving into quarterly sales planning and not just any old quarterly sales planning, because I'm sure you've been there, done that. Right?\nHow do you plan so that your quarterly sales planning actually increases your results? There are key core elements that I want you to focus on in order to make sure it's simple. It's easy! It's straightforward! And more importantly: you'll follow through on your plans. Ready? Let\u2019s dive in!\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nQuarterly planning can't be done in isolation.\nA quarter is a time period of three months. There are 4 quarters a year.\nA question to ask yourself: What is your goal for the whole year?\nEverything needs to connect together.\nThere's a specific order of operations that makes life a lot more fulfilling, more productive and more effective.\nBusiness can be simple.

This episode is going to be helpful for you in understanding how to reframe this along with specific strategies and exercises that you can use either personally, or with your sales teams.\nI\u2019ve had to overcome my fair share of fears and it is something that I still work actively with every single day, because although I'm not as afraid as I was before... I very much understand the world that you come from, perhaps that you're in currently, because it can feel aggressive. In today's episode we're going to talk all about a powerful mindset built through three simple strategies to stop being afraid to sell.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nWe have a fear of rejection.\u00a0\nYour brain doesn't know the difference when it faces real fear or something similar, the response is going to be the same.\nThe great news is that you're afraid, but your potential client is equally afraid.\nThere is no one person on the planet that is immune to feeling fear because we all have the same parts of our brain.\nFear is an essential part of staying alive, but we don\u2019t need to be afraid to sell.\u00a0\nThink about what you actually are so afraid of.\nNot everything is going to work out exactly as you plan.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nThe biggest challenge that business owners have [02:09]\nJoin my Inner Circle: Sales Mastery Society [02:51]\nWhat types of fears are we dealing with [03:16]\nWhat creates fear in us [10:33]\nThe First Strategy to Stop Being Afraid to Sell [11:27]\nThe Second Strategy to Stop Being Afraid to Sell [15:36]\nThe Third Strategy to Stop Being Afraid to Sell [20:54]\nHow I stopped being afraid [24:30]\n\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Previously Episodes Mentioned On This Episode and Powerful Resource Episodes:\n\nEpisode 81 - 5 Strategies to Get More Clients Even With A Tiny List Audience Or Following - Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep81\nEpisode 77 - How to Market Differently to Maximize Your Opportunities With Hot, Warm and Cold Leads - Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep77\nEpisode 102 -\u00a0 5 Simple Strategies to Deal with Sales Rejection - Listen Now: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep102\n\n\u00a0\nNeed consistent leads?\nBefore you spend more hours on any social media platform, make sure you know how to generate consistent leads on demand.

        "human_post": "# How to Stop Being Afraid to Sell\n\nFeeling nervous about selling? You're not the only one. Many people get anxious about sales, worried about rejection or seeming pushy. But fear doesn't have to stop you. In this post, we'll look at ways to overcome your fear of selling and boost your confidence.\n\n## Understanding the Fear\n\nFirst, know that it's normal to feel scared of selling. It's common to worry about rejection or being too aggressive. Accepting this fear is the first step to overcoming it. Realizing it's okay to be afraid can take off some pressure.\n\n## Change How You Think About Selling\n\nTry to see selling differently. Instead of thinking you're forcing a product on someone, focus on the value you're offering. Believe in what you're selling and its benefits. Remember, selling isn't about pushing unwanted products but about solving someone's problem.\n\n## Build Your Confidence\n\nConfidence is crucial in sales. Practice your pitch and learn about your product or service. The more you know, the more comfortable you'll feel. Also, use positive affirmations and surround yourself with supportive people.\n\n## Accept Rejection\n\nRejection is part of selling. Instead of fearing it, see each \"no\" as a step closer to \"yes.\" Think of rejection as a chance to learn, not a personal failure. This can make it less scary.\n\n## Focus on Relationships\n\nSelling is about relationships, not just transactions. Aim to connect with customers personally. When you focus on helping and building genuine relationships, selling feels more natural.\n\n## Listen Actively\n\nGood selling involves listening. Understand your customer's needs before you start selling. This lets you tailor your approach to their specific needs, making selling feel easier.\n\n## Start Small\n\nIf selling feels too much, start small. Try selling to friends and family first. This can help you build confidence without too much pressure. Then, slowly reach out to more people.\n\n## Get Support and Learn\n\nDon't hesitate to seek help and learn more about selling. There are many resources, like books, podcasts, workshops, and courses, to improve your skills. Learning more shows you're serious about overcoming your fear.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBeating your fear of selling is doable with the right mindset and tactics. By changing how you view selling, building confidence, accepting rejection, focusing on relationships, listening well, starting small, and seeking help, you can overcome your fear. Remember, selling is about connecting and providing value, not being pushy. With time and practice, you can turn your fear into motivation and success in sales.",

        "human_post": "# Intuitive Selling\n\nStruggling with sales? Feel like it's not your strong suit? Intuitive selling might be the key. It's about deeply understanding your clients and connecting with them authentically. This approach focuses on empathy and tailored solutions, making sales feel more natural and effective. Let's dive into what intuitive selling is and how it can change your sales game.\n\n## What is Intuitive Selling?\n\n### Building Real Connections\nIntuitive selling is all about genuine relationships. It involves getting to know your clients' real needs, their challenges, and what they're aiming for. By empathizing with them, you build trust, which is crucial for a successful sales relationship.\n\n### Empathetic Listening\nThis approach requires you to really listen and empathize. Pay attention to what your clients are saying and their non-verbal signals. Showing that you genuinely care about their problems leads to better, more open conversations.\n\n### Personalized Solutions\nForget the one-size-fits-all method. Intuitive selling means offering solutions that specifically address your clients' unique needs. This shows that you value their success over just making a sale.\n\n## How to Master Intuitive Selling\n\n### Ask Meaningful Questions\nGood intuitive selling involves asking questions that really make your clients think and reveal their deeper needs and motivations.

        "human_post": "# 3 Strategies to a Million Dollar Network\n\nBuilding a million-dollar network isn't just about attending events; it's about strategic relationship building. Here's how you can create a network that brings you incredible opportunities:\n\n## 1. Authentic Relationship Building\n\n### Be Yourself\nAuthenticity is crucial. Show genuine interest in others and be yourself. People appreciate sincerity and are more likely to connect with you on a deeper level.\n\n### Offer Value\nFocus on what you can offer, not just what you can get. Share your knowledge, make introductions, or provide support. This approach strengthens your relationships and makes you a valuable member of your network.\n\n### Listen and Understand\nReally listen to others. Understand their needs and challenges. This helps you find ways to support them and builds stronger, more meaningful connections.\n\n## 2. Strategic Networking\n\n### Set Clear Goals\nBefore networking, know what you want to achieve. This could be finding clients, partners, or mentors. Clear goals help you focus your networking efforts.\n\n### Choose the Right Events\nNot all events are beneficial. Attend ones where you're likely to meet people who align with your goals. This could be industry conferences, community events, or online groups.\n\n### Keep in Touch\nNetworking doesn't stop when the event ends. Follow up with new contacts, connect on social media, and keep the conversation going. Regular follow-ups are essential for growing your network.\n\n## 3. Give Before You Ask\n\n### Help Others\nOffer help without expecting anything in return. Share your expertise, make introductions, or provide resources. This generosity strengthens your relationships.\n\n### Connect Others\nIf you know someone who could help a contact, introduce them. Being a connector enhances your value in your network.\n\n### Show Appreciation\nAlways thank those who help you. A simple thank-you note or gesture can strengthen your connections and build goodwill.\n\nIn conclusion, a million-dollar network is built on genuine relationships, strategic networking, and a generous spirit. Be authentic, intentional, and always ready to help. Remember, it's the quality of connections, not the quantity, that makes your network truly valuable. Go out there, be genuine, strategic, and giving. Your million-dollar network is waiting!",

        "human_post": "# What You Need to Know to Be Successful at Selling\n\nHey there, aspiring sales champion! It\u2019s great to have you here. If you\u2019re reading this, chances are you\u2019re looking for some tips on how to really crush it in the world of sales. Well, you\u2019ve come to the right place. \n\nI\u2019ve been in the sales game for quite some time now, and let me tell you, it\u2019s no walk in the park. But with the right mindset, skills, and strategies, you can absolutely make a name for yourself and reach your full potential. Here\u2019s what you need to know to be successful at selling:\n\n## Understanding Your Product Inside and Out\n\nFirst things first, you need to know your product like the back of your hand. Whether you\u2019re selling a physical item, a service, or even an idea, understanding its ins and outs is crucial. This means knowing its features, benefits, and most importantly, how it solves your customers\u2019 problems. When you can articulate these things clearly and confidently, your customers will have more trust in what you\u2019re offering.\n\n## Knowing Your Audience\n\nA successful salesperson understands their audience and knows how to tailor their pitch to fit their needs. Take the time to understand your target market - what are their pain points, desires, and motivators? Once you truly understand your audience, you can position your product as the solution they\u2019ve been searching for.\n\n## Building Relationships, Not Just Making Sales\n\nSales is not just about making a quick buck; it\u2019s about building long-lasting relationships. Focus on creating a genuine connection with your customers. Show them that you truly care about helping them and that you\u2019re not just there to make a sale. When you prioritize building relationships, you\u2019ll find that repeat business and referrals come naturally.\n\n## Effective Communication Skills\n\nCommunication is at the core of sales. To be successful, you need to be an exceptional communicator. This means being a good listener, asking the right questions, and being able to articulate your thoughts clearly. Effective communication also involves being confident and charismatic without coming off as pushy or insincere.\n\n## Being Persistent and Resilient\n\nRejection is part and parcel of sales. You will hear \"no\" more times than you can count, but it\u2019s important to not let that discourage you. Successful salespeople are persistent and resilient. They understand that a no today doesn\u2019t mean a no forever. They keep pushing forward, learning from rejections, and always striving for the next yes.\n\n## Leveraging Technology and Tools\n\nIn this digital age, there are countless tools and technologies that can make your sales efforts more efficient and effective. Whether it\u2019s a customer relationship management (CRM) software, social media platforms, or email marketing tools, familiarize yourself with the technologies that can support your sales journey.\n\n## Continuous Learning and Improvement\n\nThe sales landscape is constantly evolving, so it\u2019s important to commit to continuous learning and improvement.

        "human_post_html": "<h1 class=\"h1-class\">What You Need to Know to Be Successful at Selling</h1>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Hey there, aspiring sales champion! It\u2019s great to have you here. If you\u2019re reading this, chances are you\u2019re looking for some tips on how to really crush it in the world of sales. Well, you\u2019ve come to the right place. </p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">I\u2019ve been in the sales game for quite some time now, and let me tell you, it\u2019s no walk in the park. But with the right mindset, skills, and strategies, you can absolutely make a name for yourself and reach your full potential. Here\u2019s what you need to know to be successful at selling:</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Understanding Your Product Inside and Out</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">First things first, you need to know your product like the back of your hand. Whether you\u2019re selling a physical item, a service, or even an idea, understanding its ins and outs is crucial. This means knowing its features, benefits, and most importantly, how it solves your customers\u2019 problems. When you can articulate these things clearly and confidently, your customers will have more trust in what you\u2019re offering.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Knowing Your Audience</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">A successful salesperson understands their audience and knows how to tailor their pitch to fit their needs. Take the time to understand your target market - what are their pain points, desires, and motivators? Once you truly understand your audience, you can position your product as the solution they\u2019ve been searching for.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Building Relationships, Not Just Making Sales</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Sales is not just about making a quick buck; it\u2019s about building long-lasting relationships. Focus on creating a genuine connection with your customers. Show them that you truly care about helping them and that you\u2019re not just there to make a sale. When you prioritize building relationships, you\u2019ll find that repeat business and referrals come naturally.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Effective Communication Skills</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Communication is at the core of sales. To be successful, you need to be an exceptional communicator. This means being a good listener, asking the right questions, and being able to articulate your thoughts clearly. Effective communication also involves being confident and charismatic without coming off as pushy or insincere.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Being Persistent and Resilient</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Rejection is part and parcel of sales. You will hear \"no\" more times than you can count, but it\u2019s important to not let that discourage you. Successful salespeople are persistent and resilient. They understand that a no today doesn\u2019t mean a no forever. They keep pushing forward, learning from rejections, and always striving for the next yes.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Leveraging Technology and Tools</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">In this digital age, there are countless tools and technologies that can make your sales efforts more efficient and effective. Whether it\u2019s a customer relationship management (CRM) software, social media platforms, or email marketing tools, familiarize yourself with the technologies that can support your sales journey.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Continuous Learning and Improvement</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">The sales landscape is constantly evolving, so it\u2019s important to commit to continuous learning and improvement. Stay updated on industry trends, sales tactics, and personal development. Whether it\u2019s through books, podcasts, courses, or mentorship, always be open to learning and growing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">There you have it - the key elements to being successful at selling. It\u2019s not just about having a smooth talk or a charming personality. It\u2019s about truly understanding your product and your audience, building genuine connections, honing your communication skills, and staying persistent in the face of challenges.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">So, if you\u2019re willing to put in the effort and embrace these elements, I have no doubt that you can achieve great success in the world of sales. Remember, it\u2019s not just about making sales; it\u2019s about making a difference in your customers\u2019 lives. Now go out there and show the world what you\u2019re made of!

        "human_post": "# Story Selling\n\nAre you struggling to capture your audience's attention? Do you find it challenging to make your products or services stand out in a crowded market? The key to successful sales and marketing lies in the art of storytelling. Story selling is a powerful technique that can help you connect with your audience on a deeper level, convey your brand's message, and drive engagement and sales. In this blog post, we'll explore the concept of story selling and provide practical tips on how to incorporate compelling narratives into your sales and marketing strategies.\n\n## Understanding Story Selling\n\n### What is Story Selling?\nStory selling is the practice of using narratives to engage, persuade, and influence potential customers. It involves crafting and sharing stories that resonate with your audience, evoke emotions, and ultimately lead them to take action, such as making a purchase or subscribing to a service. \n\n### Why Story Selling Works\nHumans are inherently wired to respond to stories. Our brains are naturally drawn to narratives, and we tend to remember information better when it's presented in a story format. By leveraging the power of storytelling, businesses can capture attention, build trust, and create a memorable impression on their audience.\n\n## Incorporating Storytelling into Sales and Marketing\n\n### Know Your Audience\nEffective story selling begins with understanding your audience. Take the time to research and empathize with your target customers. What are their pain points, desires, and motivations? Tailor your stories to address these aspects, making them relatable and impactful.\n\n### Use Personal Anecdotes\nShare personal anecdotes or customer success stories that illustrate the benefits of your product or service. Authentic stories help humanize your brand and build rapport with your audience. People are more likely to connect with a story that feels genuine and relevant to their own experiences.\n\n### Create Emotional Connections\nEmotions play a crucial role in decision-making. Craft stories that evoke emotions such as joy, inspiration, or empathy. By connecting with your audience on an emotional level, you can create a lasting impression and influence their purchasing decisions.\n\n### Showcase Authenticity\nTransparency and authenticity are integral to successful story selling. Share the behind-the-scenes of your business, including the challenges, triumphs, and lessons learned. Authenticity builds trust and fosters a stronger connection with your audience.\n\n## Tips for Effective Story Selling\n\n### Keep it Simple\nAvoid overwhelming your audience with complex or lengthy stories. Keep your narratives simple, clear, and to the point. The goal is to engage, not to confuse or lose your audience's interest.\n\n### Highlight Benefits\nFocus on showcasing the benefits of your product or service within your stories. How has it positively impacted the lives of your customers? Highlighting these benefits can make your stories more compelling and persuasive.\n\n### Utilize Multiple Platforms\nIncorporate storytelling across various platforms, including your website, social media, email campaigns, and in-person interactions. Consistency in storytelling helps reinforce your brand's message and create a cohesive experience for your audience.\n\n### Continuously Refine Your Stories\nPay attention to the feedback and reactions from your audience. Refine and adapt your stories based on what resonates most with them. Storytelling is an evolving process, and it's essential to continuously refine and improve your narratives.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStory selling is a powerful tool for businesses looking to captivate and convert their audience. By understanding the psychological impact of storytelling and incorporating compelling narratives into your sales and marketing strategies, you can create a lasting impression, build trust, and drive meaningful engagement with your customers. Embrace the art of storytelling and unlock the full potential of your brand's message. Start weaving stories that resonate, connect, and ultimately sell.\n\nRemember, everyone loves a great story \u2013 why not make yours one worth remembering?",

        "human_post": "# 3 Reasons Why You Struggle to Sell\n\nHello, entrepreneurs! Struggling with sales is a common hurdle, but understanding the root causes can pave the way for improvement. Let's explore three primary reasons you might be facing challenges in making sales.\n\n## 1. Lack of Confidence\nConfidence is crucial in sales, and lacking it can be a major obstacle. Here's how a lack of confidence might be affecting your sales:\n\n- **Impostor Syndrome:** Feeling like you're not genuinely qualified can hinder your sales efforts. Remember, your expertise and experience are valid and valuable.\n- **Fear of Rejection:** It's normal to fear rejection, but remember, each \"no\" is a step closer to \"yes.\" Rejection is a part of the sales journey.\n- **Uncertainty About Your Value:** If you're not convinced of your own value, it's challenging to persuade others. Believe in your product or service and its benefits.\n\n## 2. Ineffective Communication\nGood communication is key to sales success. If you're struggling here, it could be due to:\n\n- **Poor Understanding of Customer Needs:** To sell effectively, you need to deeply understand your customer's needs and how your offering addresses them.\n- **Not Listening Enough:** Sales involve listening as much as talking. Ensure you're genuinely understanding customer concerns and feedback.\n- **Lack of a Compelling Narrative:** People are drawn to stories and solutions, not just products. Ensure you're communicating your offering compellingly.\n\n## 3. Underestimating Relationship Building\nSales are often built on relationships. If you're not focusing enough on this aspect, it could be a setback:\n\n- **Neglecting Follow-Ups:** Following up with leads and clients is crucial. It shows persistence and interest in their needs.\n- **Over-Focusing on the Sale:** Sales should be about more than just transactions. Focus on building genuine connections for long-term success.\n- **Ignoring Current Customers:** Your existing customers are a valuable asset. Maintaining these relationships can lead to repeat business and referrals.\n\n## Conclusion\nIdentifying these issues is the first step toward improving your sales approach. Work on building your confidence, enhancing your communication skills, and fostering strong relationships. Remember, overcoming sales challenges is a part of the entrepreneurial journey. Stay persistent, keep learning, and you'll find your stride. You've got this!",

Embrace a Growth Mindset \ud83c\udf31</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">View rejection as an opportunity to learn and grow. Believe that with effort, you can improve and succeed. Every setback is a chance to develop your skills and resilience.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">2. Seek Feedback and Learn from It \ud83e\udd14</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Don't just move on from a rejection. Ask for feedback to understand what went wrong and how you can improve. This insight is invaluable for refining your sales approach.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">3. Reframe Rejection as a Numbers Game \ud83d\udcc8</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Remember, sales is a numbers game. Each \"no\" is a step closer to a \"yes.\" Keep engaging with more prospects, and don't let rejection slow you down.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">4. Practice Resilience and Positive Self-Talk \ud83d\udcaa</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Stay resilient and engage in positive self-talk. Remind yourself of your worth and abilities. A confident mindset can significantly impact how you handle rejection.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">5. Refocus and Stay Persistent \ud83c\udfaf</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">After a rejection, take a moment to reassess, adjust your strategy, and keep going. Persistence is key in sales. Stay focused on your goals and maintain a positive attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">In conclusion, sales rejection is part of the process, but it's how you handle it that counts. Use these strategies to turn rejection into a stepping stone for success. Remember, every \"no\" is just another step on your path to a big \"yes!\" Keep learning, stay positive, and keep pushing forward! \ud83d\ude80</p>\n",

        "human_post": "# ClubHouse Sales Strategies - An Update On How to Get High Quality Leads and Clients \ud83d\ude80\n\nAre you looking to level up your sales game and attract high-quality leads and clients on Clubhouse? The social audio app has quickly gained popularity as a powerful platform for connecting with potential customers and growing your business. In this blog post, we'll explore some updated strategies to help you get the most out of Clubhouse and turn your efforts into meaningful results. \ud83c\udf1f\n\n## Crafting a Compelling Profile \ud83d\udcbc\n\nYour Clubhouse profile is the first impression you make on potential leads and clients. It's essential to make it compelling and informative to attract the right people. Here are a few tips for optimizing your profile:\n\n- **Clear and Concise Bio**: Craft a clear and concise bio that describes who you are, what you do, and whom you serve. Use keywords that resonate with your target audience. \ud83d\udcdd\n\n- **Professional Headshot**: A professional-looking headshot can go a long way in establishing credibility and trust. Make sure your profile picture represents your brand well. \ud83d\udcf8\n\n- **Link to Your Website or Landing Page**: Including a link to your website or a specific landing page can drive traffic and capture leads directly from your Clubhouse profile. \ud83d\udd17\n\n## Engaging and Providing Value \ud83d\udcac\n\nOnce your profile is set up, the next step is to engage with the Clubhouse community and provide value to your audience. Here are some effective strategies:\n\n- **Join Relevant Rooms**: Look for rooms relevant to your industry or target market and actively participate in discussions. Offering valuable insights can position you as an authority in your field. \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\n\n- **Host Your Own Rooms**: Hosting your own rooms gives you the opportunity to showcase your expertise and connect with potential clients. Consider hosting Q&A sessions, workshops, or networking events. \ud83c\udfa4\n\n- **Collaborate with Others**: Partnering with other users to co-host rooms or events can help you expand your reach and attract new leads. Leverage the networks of your co-hosts to connect with a wider audience. \ud83e\udd1d\n\n## Convert Clubhouse Connections into Leads \ud83d\udcc8\n\nBuilding connections on Clubhouse is just the beginning. To turn these connections into high-quality leads and clients, you need a strategic approach. Here's how you can do that:\n\n- **Direct Call-to-Actions**: During your conversations in rooms or while speaking, provide clear call-to-actions for listeners to connect with you off the platform. This could be directing them to your website, offering a free resource, or inviting them to schedule a consultation. \ud83d\udce2\n\n- **Follow-Up Outside Clubhouse**: Once you've made a promising connection on Clubhouse, take the conversation outside the platform. This could be through email, social media, or scheduling a one-on-one call to further discuss their needs and how you can help. \ud83d\udcde\n\n- **Provide Consistent Value**: Whether through regular rooms, collaborations with industry experts, or sharing valuable content, consistently providing value will keep your audience engaged and interested in your offerings. \ud83c\udf1f\n\n## Conclusion: Go Forth and Connect! \ud83d\ude80\n\nClubhouse offers a unique opportunity to connect with high-quality leads and clients in a more personal and engaging way. By crafting a compelling profile, engaging with the community, and strategically converting connections into leads, you can make the most of this platform for your sales efforts. Now that you're equipped with updated strategies, it's time to put them into action and watch your business grow. \ud83d\udcc8\n\nRemember, building meaningful relationships and providing value should always be at the core of your sales strategy on Clubhouse.

        "human_post": "# The Single Biggest Lie You Need to Stop Telling Yourself Right Now\n\nHey there! Are you guilty of telling yourself a little white lie that's been holding you back? We've all been there, but it's time to face the truth and break free from this self-sabotaging mindset. Let's dive in and uncover the single biggest lie you need to stop telling yourself right now.\n\n## The Lie: \"I'm Not Good Enough\" \ud83d\ude14\n\n### Understanding the Lie\nSo many of us fall into the trap of believing that we're not good enough. Whether it's in our personal relationships, our careers, or our self-image, this lie can wreak havoc on our confidence and overall well-being. It often stems from comparing ourselves to others and feeling inadequate as a result.\n\n### Breaking It Down\nLet's break this down together. The truth is, you are more than good enough. You are unique, talented, and worthy of all the good things life has to offer. You bring something to the table that no one else does, and that in itself makes you invaluable. Embracing your individuality and celebrating your strengths is the key to breaking free from this limiting belief.\n\n## Embracing Your Worth \ud83c\udf1f\n\n### Recognizing Your Value\nIt's time to shift your mindset and recognize your inherent value. Take a moment to reflect on your accomplishments, your resilience in the face of challenges, and the positive impact you've had on others. You are capable, deserving, and full of potential. Your worth is not determined by external factors or the standards of others\u2014it comes from within.\n\n### Practicing Self-Compassion \u2764\ufe0f\nLearning to be kind to yourself is essential in overcoming the \"I'm not good enough\" lie. Practice self-compassion by treating yourself with the same understanding and support that you would offer a close friend. Be gentle with your thoughts and cultivate a sense of appreciation for who you are, flaws and all.\n\n## Moving Forward with Confidence \ud83d\udcaa\n\n### Setting Realistic Goals \ud83c\udfaf\nInstead of holding yourself to unrealistic standards, strive to set goals that align with your values and aspirations. Break larger goals into manageable steps, and celebrate your progress along the way. By focusing on achievable milestones, you'll gain confidence in your abilities and dispel the notion that you're not good enough.\n\n### Surrounding Yourself with Support \ud83d\udc65\nSeek out the support of friends, family, or mentors who uplift and encourage you. Surrounding yourself with positive influences can help challenge the negative beliefs you hold about yourself. Remember, you deserve to be surrounded by people who see your worth and believe in your potential.\n\n## Embracing Your True Potential \u2728\n\n### Practicing Self-Affirmations \ud83d\udcac\nAffirmations are a powerful tool for rewiring your thoughts and beliefs about yourself. Start each day by affirming your worth, capabilities, and potential. Repeat phrases such as \"I am enough,\" \"I am worthy,\" and \"I trust in my abilities\" to reinforce a positive and empowering self-image.\n\n### Stepping Out of Your Comfort Zone \ud83d\ude80\nAs you begin to shed the \"I'm not good enough\" mindset, challenge yourself to step out of your comfort zone. Take on new opportunities, embrace your passions, and pursue growth with a fearless attitude. Each new experience will reinforce your belief in your own abilities and propel you forward on your journey.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt's time to release yourself from the grip of the \"I'm not good enough\" lie. You are inherently worthy, capable, and deserving of all the success and happiness that comes your way. Embrace your unique qualities, show yourself compassion, surround yourself with support, and watch as your confidence soars. You've got this! \ud83d\udc4c\n",

Instead of making things more complicated, today we are bringing it back to simple principles so you can fix these mistakes right now. This applies if you\u2019re starting out, growing your business or scaling because you may be getting stuck in the \u201cexpert's curse\u201d and overthinking things instead of focusing on what works.

Not because we necessarily need it.\nIf you understand the motivation for why your ideal client wants to buy you never have to feel like selling.\u00a0\nUnderstand what makes your offers irresistible.\u00a0\nHow are you making it simple for the people you want to work with to actually find you?\u00a0\nHow do you create more opportunities without having to work harder and harder and harder?\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nThe First Big Mistake that Business Owners make [02:07]\nFixing the First Big Mistake [04:27]\nHow to get your next 100 leads [06:02]\nThe Second Big Mistake that Business Owners make [07:08]\nHow to: breaking down the steps [07:45]\nThe Third Big Mistake that Business Owners make [10:40]\nHow to create irresistible offers [14:27]\nSimple ways to fix the three biggest mistakes [16:35]\n\n\u00a0\nConfused about your profit making niche?

Do you find yourself constantly falling short of your goals despite putting in a lot of effort? It\u2019s frustrating, isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone. Many business owners and sales professionals face similar challenges.\n\nThe good news is that there are simple ways to turn things around. By identifying and addressing the biggest mistakes that kill your sales, you can start seeing improvements in no time. Let\u2019s take a look at these common pitfalls and explore some practical solutions.\n\n## 1. Neglecting the Importance of Building Rapport \ud83e\udd1d\n\n### The Mistake:\nOne of the most common mistakes that can kill your sales is neglecting the importance of building rapport with your prospects. In today\u2019s highly competitive marketplace, customers are looking for more than just a product or service \u2013 they want to connect with the people behind the brand.\n\n### The Solution:\nStart by focusing on the human aspect of sales. Take the time to understand your prospects' needs and challenges. Show genuine interest in building a relationship, rather than just pushing for a sale. Personalize your interactions and find common ground to connect on a deeper level. When people feel understood and valued, they are more likely to trust you and ultimately make a purchase.\n\n## 2. Lack of Active Listening \ud83d\udc42\n\n### The Mistake:\nAnother big mistake that can kill your sales is the lack of active listening. Many sales professionals make the blunder of talking too much and not listening enough. This not only hinders effective communication but also leads to missed opportunities to address the prospect's specific concerns.\n\n### The Solution:\nPractice active listening in every interaction. Pay close attention to what your prospects are saying, and ask clarifying questions to ensure you fully understand their needs. Resist the urge to interrupt or dominate the conversation. When prospects feel heard and understood, they are more likely to trust your recommendations and move forward with a purchase.\n\n## 3. Failing to Differentiate Your Offering \ud83c\udf1f\n\n### The Mistake:\nFailing to differentiate your offering from the competition is another common mistake that can significantly impact your sales. In today's crowded marketplace, customers are bombarded with options, making it crucial for businesses to stand out and showcase their unique value.\n\n### The Solution:\nTake the time to clearly articulate what sets your product or service apart from the rest. Identify your unique selling points and emphasize them in your sales pitch. Whether it\u2019s superior quality, unmatched convenience, or exceptional customer service, make sure your prospects understand why choosing your offering is the best decision for them. By effectively communicating your value proposition, you can capture the attention and interest of potential buyers.\n\nIn conclusion, it\u2019s important to recognize and address these common mistakes that can hamper your sales efforts. By prioritizing rapport building, practicing active listening, and differentiating your offering, you can set yourself up for sales success. Remember, sales is as much about connecting with people as it is about promoting a product or service. So, take the time to understand your prospects, listen attentively, and showcase the unique value you bring to the table. With these simple fixes, you can start turning the tide and achieving the results you desire. Happy selling! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udcbc",

        "human_post": "# Which Metric Could Be Causing More Work for You Without You Realizing It \ud83d\udcca\ud83e\udd14\n\nHello, business owners and marketing pros! Let's talk about a sneaky metric that might be adding to your workload without your knowledge. Metrics are vital for gauging marketing success, but focusing on the wrong ones can lead you astray.\n\n## The Trap of Vanity Metrics \ud83d\ude80\n\nIn digital marketing, it's tempting to fixate on vanity metrics like website hits, social media likes, and email open rates. While these can offer some insights, they might not align with your core business objectives, leading to misguided efforts.\n\n### The Vanity Metric Issue \ud83d\udcc9\nThe problem? Vanity metrics can be misleading. They look impressive but may not translate into tangible business outcomes. High social media engagement is great, but if it's not converting to sales, it's not contributing to your bottom line.\n\n## The Critical Metric: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) \ud83d\udcb8\n\nThe metric that might be overloading your plate is **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**. This is the total cost of sales and marketing efforts needed to gain a new customer. It's a direct indicator of profitability. A high CAC means you're spending more to acquire customers than what they bring in, which is unsustainable.\n\n### High CAC: The Hidden Culprits \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nSeveral factors can drive up your CAC. Targeting the wrong audience or having an inefficient sales process can inflate costs without you realizing it.\n\n## Strategies to Lower Your CAC \ud83d\udcc9\n\nReducing your CAC is achievable with strategic planning and some adjustments.\n\n### Focus on the Right Audience \ud83c\udfaf\nEnsure your marketing targets the audience most likely to convert. Revisit your customer personas and align your efforts accordingly.\n\n### Streamline Your Sales Process \ud83d\ude80\nLook for inefficiencies in your sales funnel. Smoothing out these areas can make the customer journey more efficient, reducing your CAC.\n\n### Boost Customer Retention \ud83d\udd04\nFocusing on existing customers can also lower your CAC. It's often cheaper to retain customers than acquire new ones. Implement loyalty programs and exceptional service to keep your current customers engaged.\n\n## Conclusion: Rethink Your Metrics \ud83d\udd04\n\nShift your focus from vanity metrics to those impacting your bottom line, like CAC. This change can reduce unnecessary work and drive more meaningful business results. Lowering your CAC is a gradual process, but with targeted strategies and continuous improvement, it's within reach.\n\nSo, take a moment to reassess your marketing strategies. Are you chasing the right metrics? Your future success (and sanity) might depend on it! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udca1",

These simple, and sometimes seemingly silly mistakes, completely change a \"yes, I want to buy\" to an \"ah, maybe. Let me think about it.\u201d Can you relate?\nThat's why I decided to dive into this topic so you understand why a \"maybe\" can be worse than a \"no\" and how you can guide a conversation to achieve the sale you want for your service or product. The number one reason why follow up doesn\u2019t happen is because I see clients not understand what the heck they are following up about. It\u2019s hard to sell if it feels like you\u2019re chasing after someone who might not even be interested in what you have to offer, right?\u00a0\nSelling is serving and serving involves taking the lead to speak with clients so you can understand what they want and need. That's why this episode is so important! Selling is a skill that can be learned and improved. Want to know how? Let\u2019s press play and find out.\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nSelling is all about serving\nThe goal is to get an answer and an answer that is straightforward enough that you understand what the next steps look like in the event of a sale.\nWhen you step into maybe-land it's because you didn't have a clear goal and a clear outcome that you wanted to accomplish in your sales conversation in the first place.\nIf you aren't the one that is asking questions and your potential client is all of a sudden drilling you, you have lost control over the entire conversation\nIf you don't ask the right questions that also allow that person to be part of the conversation you won't sell well\nIf your clients don't feel like there is an appropriateness to what it is that you're recommending as the expert, it doesn't matter what the price point is\nThe more research that you do, there's incrementally better results\nWhen you feel confident and connected to your ideal clients, it's going to be a lot easier for you to be able to sell your services and your products with more ease\nIt starts with you\nSales is not something that all of us have to be naturally good at, but it is a skill that we can all master with the right know-how!\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nWhat are some best practices for a sales conversation that goes really well [01:33]\nThe very 1st thing that makes sales conversations go horribly wrong [02:08]\nWhy the goal is not necessarily to make a sale. [03:39]\nWhy the \"Maybe\" is the trickiest and the worst thing [04:10]\nThe 2nd reason why sales conversations go horribly wrong [05:12]\nSell With More Ease [06:32]\nThe 3rd reason why sales conversations go horribly wrong [09:42]\nWhere is the sweet spot on Sales [13:33]\nYour ideal clients are a variety of personality types. How to research it more [13:59]\n\n\u00a0\nNeed consistent leads?\nBefore you spend more hours on any social media platform, make sure you know how to generate consistent leads on demand. Don\u2019t get trapped spending hours with little to show for your efforts or talking to tire kickers who have no intention to buy from you! In 5 days you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re offering, who your best buyer is and what they are actually buying so you can create a never ending supply of leads.\nThe best part? You can grab yours for a limited time only $7 instead of $97! \ud83d\udca5www.susanmcvea.com/consistentleads\nSponsored by:\nSales Mastery Society: Want to close $2,000 - $800,000 contracts just like my clients?

Let's dive into why these convos can crash and burn, and how you can steer them back on track.\n\n## Lack of Preparation \ud83d\udcda\n\n### Not Researching the Prospect\nJumping into a call without homework? Big no-no. Know their pain points and goals to personalize your pitch.\n\n### Not Understanding Your Product\nYou gotta know your product inside out. If you can't answer questions confidently, you're in trouble.\n\n## Selling, Not Solving \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\n\nFocusing solely on closing the deal? Wrong move. Shift to solving the prospect's problems. It builds trust and rapport, turning prospects into customers.\n\n## Not Really Listening \ud83d\udc42\n\nEver zone out planning your next point and miss what's being said? Active listening is key. It shows you care and helps you understand their needs better.\n\n## Dodging Objections \ud83d\udea7\n\nObjections are part of the game. Don't dodge or get defensive. Address them head-on with thoughtful responses. It's a chance to build trust and credibility.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, that's the scoop on why sales talks can go south.

It's not just you. Let's dive into why these convos can crash and burn, and how you can steer them back on track.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Lack of Preparation \ud83d\udcda</h2>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Not Researching the Prospect</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Jumping into a call without homework? Big no-no. Know their pain points and goals to personalize your pitch.</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Not Understanding Your Product</h3>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">You gotta know your product inside out. If you can't answer questions confidently, you're in trouble.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Selling, Not Solving \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Focusing solely on closing the deal? Wrong move. Shift to solving the prospect's problems. It builds trust and rapport, turning prospects into customers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Not Really Listening \ud83d\udc42</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Ever zone out planning your next point and miss what's being said? Active listening is key. It shows you care and helps you understand their needs better.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Dodging Objections \ud83d\udea7</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Objections are part of the game. Don't dodge or get defensive. Address them head-on with thoughtful responses.

Does it make your head spin with all the options? Well my friend, inspired by loyal listener Yani (Muryani), today we talk about exactly how to properly value not only your work, your brand, your company, but also your time and how you use it to achieve your dreams and reach your goals. You don\u2019t need to undercharge and overdeliver in order to be successful and keep customers happy. Let's dive in!\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nOnce you make a sale, you now have a debt obligation in terms of servicing the client. Something still needs to be delivered.\nThe money has not yet been earned until you fulfill your end of the bargain.\nThere's always an opportunity for you to do more.\nMake sure you maintain the boundary of what it was that you promised you would deliver.\nYou can't just do things and not expect there to be consequences.\nIf it's taking you longer than what you anticipate, you need to know that upfront.\nTime is the most precious thing.\nYou can't replace your time one hundred percent.\nIf your client doesn't have a budget for what you are trying to deliver, they're not the best client for you\nCommunication around expectations and leadership to maintain boundaries is essential.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nThe first question to dive into [02:13]\nWhat ends up happening? [03:04]\nThe number one thing that gets in the way [03:47]\nWhat you need to realize [05:35]\nWhat clients don't always understand [07:25]\nThrough those learning experiences [08:35]\nDon\u2019t forget that there's a journey [09:33]\nKey learning [11:24]\nQuick examples [11:45]\nHow our world operates [19:00]\nPowerful Tip: Document your process [20:12]\nIn case you need more help [22:21]\n\n\u00a0\nNeed consistent leads?\nBefore you spend more hours on any social media platform, make sure you know how to generate consistent leads on demand. Don\u2019t get trapped spending hours with little to show for your efforts or talking to tire kickers who have no intention to buy from you! In 5 days you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re offering, who your best buyer is and what they are actually buying so you can create a never ending supply of leads.\nThe best part?

        "human_post": "# The #1 Reason Why You Don't See The Results You're Actually Looking For \ud83c\udfaf\n\nStruggling to achieve your goals despite your best efforts? The root cause might be simpler than you think. Let's explore the primary reason you're not seeing the results you desire and how to turn things around.\n\n## The Culprit: Lack of Clarity \ud83e\uddd0\n\nThe main obstacle to achieving your goals is often a lack of clarity. Without a clear vision, your efforts can be misdirected or ineffective. Here's how a lack of clarity might be holding you back:\n\n### Vague Goals \ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f\n- **Unclear Objectives**: Goals like \"I want to be successful\" are too vague. Specificity, like \"I want to increase my business revenue by 20% in 6 months,\" provides a clear target.\n\n### Indecision \ud83d\udd04\n- **Shifting Focus**: Constantly changing goals or strategies leads to fragmented efforts and minimal progress.\n\n### Distractibility \ud83d\udea6\n- **Misaligned Efforts**: Without a clear goal, it's easy to chase after the wrong things, leading to wasted time and energy.\n\n## Harnessing the Power of Clarity \ud83d\udd0d\n\nClarity can transform your approach and significantly increase your chances of success. Here's what clarity enables you to do:\n\n### Strategic Planning \ud83d\udcc8\n- **Focused Action**: A clear goal allows you to develop a targeted plan, streamlining your path to success.\n\n### Sustained Motivation \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Driven by Vision**: Clarity fuels your drive, keeping you motivated even during challenging times.\n\n### Informed Decision-Making \ud83e\udd14\n- **Aligned Choices**: Clear goals help you make decisions that consistently align with your desired outcome.\n\n## Cultivating Clarity \ud83c\udf31\n\nAchieving clarity might seem daunting, but it's within your reach. Here are some steps to help you gain clarity and start seeing real results:\n\n### Reflect on Values and Priorities \ud83c\udf1f\n- **Personal Alignment**: Understand what truly matters to you and align your goals accordingly.\n\n### Set SMART Goals \ud83c\udfaf\n- **Effective Goal-Setting**: Utilize the Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound framework for goal-setting.\n\n### Practice Visualization \ud83d\udc40\n\n- **See Success**: Regularly visualize achieving your goals to reinforce your commitment and belief.\n\n### Embrace Action \ud83d\udc4c\n\n- **Learn by Doing**: Sometimes, clarity emerges through action. Start moving, and adjust as you gain more insight.\n\n## Conclusion \ud83c\udf09\n\nClarity is the key to unlocking the results you seek. By defining clear goals, aligning them with your values, and taking focused action, you can transform your efforts into tangible achievements. Remember, it's never too late to gain clarity.

The root cause might be simpler than you think. Let's explore the primary reason you're not seeing the results you desire and how to turn things around.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">The Culprit: Lack of Clarity \ud83e\uddd0</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">The main obstacle to achieving your goals is often a lack of clarity. Without a clear vision, your efforts can be misdirected or ineffective. Here's how a lack of clarity might be holding you back:</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Vague Goals \ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unclear Objectives</strong>: Goals like \"I want to be successful\" are too vague. Specificity, like \"I want to increase my business revenue by 20% in 6 months,\" provides a clear target.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Indecision \ud83d\udd04</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shifting Focus</strong>: Constantly changing goals or strategies leads to fragmented efforts and minimal progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Distractibility \ud83d\udea6</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Misaligned Efforts</strong>: Without a clear goal, it's easy to chase after the wrong things, leading to wasted time and energy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Harnessing the Power of Clarity \ud83d\udd0d</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Clarity can transform your approach and significantly increase your chances of success. Here's what clarity enables you to do:</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Strategic Planning \ud83d\udcc8</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focused Action</strong>: A clear goal allows you to develop a targeted plan, streamlining your path to success.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Sustained Motivation \ud83d\udcaa</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Driven by Vision</strong>: Clarity fuels your drive, keeping you motivated even during challenging times.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Informed Decision-Making \ud83e\udd14</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aligned Choices</strong>: Clear goals help you make decisions that consistently align with your desired outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Cultivating Clarity \ud83c\udf31</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Achieving clarity might seem daunting, but it's within your reach. Here are some steps to help you gain clarity and start seeing real results:</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Reflect on Values and Priorities \ud83c\udf1f</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Personal Alignment</strong>: Understand what truly matters to you and align your goals accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Set SMART Goals \ud83c\udfaf</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Effective Goal-Setting</strong>: Utilize the Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound framework for goal-setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Practice Visualization \ud83d\udc40</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>See Success</strong>: Regularly visualize achieving your goals to reinforce your commitment and belief.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"h3-class\">Embrace Action \ud83d\udc4c</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn by Doing</strong>: Sometimes, clarity emerges through action. Start moving, and adjust as you gain more insight.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">Conclusion \ud83c\udf09</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\">Clarity is the key to unlocking the results you seek. By defining clear goals, aligning them with your values, and taking focused action, you can transform your efforts into tangible achievements. Remember, it's never too late to gain clarity.

Now that you understand the different types of leads, let\u2019s dive deeper into how you can gain more customers if you use the right strategies to convert and create more customer loyalty. We\u2019re identifying where you are in your own sales process and how your marketing efforts can help support you in growing and maximizing those opportunities so that you can get more clients and more sales. Let's dive in!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nMost of the time, your cold market is your biggest and broadest audience.\nContent marketing is a great way to start attracting them.\nThe AIDA method: Awareness, interest, desire, and action.\nIt is about moving people from cold to warm and then warm to hot\nThe definition of a hot lead for our purposes today is somebody who is ready to buy or has made the purchase.\nYou can't just all of a sudden decide to promote only when it's time to sell.\nPeople remember how you made them feel.\nYou need to keep moving people forward and you still need to stay connected to those who are not yet ready to move forward.\nJust train your clients to take action, because the more that you can do that, the easier it becomes for them to actually take action when it comes time for them to buy.\nPeople tend to unconsciously select information that supports their views, but ignore those that contradict it.\nYou have to constantly resell your clients that the decision that they made is correct.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nThe key differences between three categories of leads that you might study and apply in your business - Episode 76 - [00:50] (Available on: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep76 )\nCold leads in terms of your marketing efforts [01:24]\nAwareness, Interest, Desire, and Action - The A.I.D.A Method [02:02]\ncontent marketing [03:05]\nIt's really important for you to have a really in-depth knowledge about this [04:43]\nThinking about marketing efforts focused on cold audience [05:39]\nMoving people from cold to warm [06:12]\nA.I.D.A.

This episode will be very specific and related to the generation of leads for your possible, probable and already customer. Let's dissect the different types of leads and how they can help your business.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nHot leads are usually the smallest percentage of your market.\nYou're going to have about 3% of the total number of people that you are talking to about your products and services that are in this hot category\nHot leads or hot deals are ones that are about to imminently close, that person is ready to buy\nYour customers are actively seeking for a solution that will solve the problem that they are struggling with.\nJust because people are not yet ready to buy, that's not a bad thing.\nWarm is better than cold because warm people have self identified in some way. They have said \"I'm interested\".\nThe sales game is a long game.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nIf you missed our previous episode where we talked about why lead generation is actually a sales problem, it is available at: https://www.susanmcvea.com/s1ep49 [01:03]\nThe Hot Leads - Understanding the Concept Behind It [01:29]\nThings to think about [03:03]\nWarm leads are people who now know about you [04:55]\nWarm is better than cold [05:55]\nHow do you identify people who are in your warm market?

Today's episode is very special, as it brings you tips, strategies and frameworks capable of changing the way you use social media and use it to serve more customers.\nMy good friend Veronica Sagastume, joins me to share how to create content on social media to attract, connect, convert and engage your audience. We talk about an easy three step framework for how you can actually create a system to organize how you're creating all of that content or repurposing content that you might already have and using what she likes to call her paint by numbers system.\u00a0\nVeronica Sagastume is an ex corporate CFO turned content marketing strategist with a passion for helping accounting, bookkeeping and tax business owners create their content to increase their visibility on social media and grow their business online. After a 20 year corporate career, as an accounting and finance executive in Silicon Valley, she made a bold decision to trade her corner office for a home office in 2011.

Facebook groups are a hidden gem for entrepreneurs and businesses looking to expand their client base. With a strategic approach, you can harness the power of these groups to attract and convert new clients. Let's delve into a detailed strategy to make the most out of Facebook groups.\n\n## Why Facebook Groups? \ud83c\udf0d\n- **Vast User Base:** Facebook's 2.7 billion active users offer a vast pool of potential clients.\n- **Niche Targeting:** Groups cater to specific interests, industries, and demographics, allowing for precise targeting.\n- **Establish Authority:** Regularly contributing valuable content can position you as an expert in your field.\n- **Personal Touch:** Direct interaction with potential clients fosters trust and personal connections, often lacking in traditional marketing.\n\n## Step-by-Step Strategy for Using Facebook Groups \ud83d\ude80\n### 1. Research and Join Relevant Groups\n   - **Identify Your Audience:** Determine the characteristics of your ideal client and search for groups where they might be active.\n   - **Quality Over Quantity:** Focus on groups with active engagement, not just large numbers.\n   - **Diverse Groups:** Join a mix of broad and niche-specific groups to widen your reach.\n\n### 2. Understand Group Dynamics\n   - **Read the Rules:** Each group has its own set of rules. Adhere to them to avoid getting banned.\n   - **Observe Interactions:** Spend time understanding the tone, common questions, and the type of content that resonates with the group.\n\n### 3. Engage Authentically\n   - **Be Helpful:** Answer questions, offer advice, and share insights without expecting anything in return.\n   - **Start Discussions:** Post thought-provoking questions or share industry news to spark conversations.\n   - **Showcase Success Stories:** Share case studies or success stories (where appropriate) that demonstrate the impact of your services.\n\n### 4. Provide Immense Value\n   - **Free Resources:** Share useful resources like eBooks, guides, or webinars.\n   - **Exclusive Content:** Create content tailored for specific groups to make members feel special.\n\n### 5. Build Relationships\n   - **Connect Personally:** Reach out to members who engage with your posts to build deeper connections.\n   - **Collaborate:** Partner with group admins or influential members for webinars or live Q&A sessions.\n\n### 6. Soft Promotion\n   - **Follow the 80/20 Rule:** 80% of your posts should be non-promotional, while 20% can softly promote your services.\n   - **Leverage Your Bio:** Use your Facebook bio to subtly promote your business.\n\n### 7. Transition to Business Conversations\n   - **Call-to-Actions:** Include soft CTAs in your posts, inviting interested members to learn more about your services.\n   - **Private Messaging:** Move conversations to private messages or emails for detailed discussions.\n\n### 8. Analyze and Adapt\n   - **Track Engagement:** Monitor which types of posts generate the most engagement and refine your strategy accordingly.\n   - **Seek Feedback:** Ask group members for feedback on the type of content they find most valuable.\n\n## Conclusion \ud83c\udf1f\n- Facebook groups are a potent tool for client acquisition when used correctly.\n- Focus on building genuine relationships and providing value.\n- Regular engagement and strategic promotion can convert group members into paying clients.\n\nStart leveraging Facebook groups today and watch your business grow! \ud83c\udf10",

This is about you matching up that opportunity for a product or service and making sure that more people have access to that in a way that makes it accessible to them, your market.\nBlessings fall from the skies, sales don't. Unless you are promoting your brand on an airplane banner, and even then, this does not guarantee anything because any and all sales or product launch processes are a direct relationship and communication with the customer.\u00a0\nOn today\u2019s episode, we're talking all about the 3 biggest launch mistakes that I see happening when you are trying to launch your product or service and get it out there into the hands of your ideal clients. Let\u2019s dive into it and find the most effective way for you to build and grow and scale your business.\n\u00a0\nBiggest Takeaways:\n\nSometimes, the thing is not about if your offer is good or not good. It could be the wrong offer.\nWhy timing matters\nThe 3 biggest mistakes can be fixed!\nPeople don't always buy what they need. They buy what they want.\nThe more opportunities that you give people to know about what it is that they could buy from you, the more likely you\u2019ll make sales.\nUnderstand how your product or service changes life for your ideal clients.\n\n\u00a0\nHighlights:\n\nWhy do people buy?

But don't worry, you're not alone in this. Let's explore the three main reasons why launches fail and how to turn the tide for your next big venture.\n\n## 1. Lack of Market Research \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nUnderstanding your audience is crucial, and skipping this step can lead to a launch that doesn't resonate. Here's what to focus on:\n\n- **Know Your Ideal Customer:** Create detailed buyer personas. Who are they? What do they need?\n- **Identify Pain Points:** Conduct surveys or interviews. What problems does your audience face that your product can solve?\n- **Right Platforms:** Are you reaching your audience where they spend their time?\n\nWithout deep market research, your launch might miss its target audience.\n\n## 2. Ineffective Marketing Strategy \ud83d\udce3\n\nA great product needs an equally great marketing strategy. If your launch didn't take off, it might be due to:\n\n- **Visibility Issues:** Are you effectively spreading the word? Assess your social media, email, and content marketing strategies.\n- **Messaging:** Is your communication clear and compelling? Your message should articulate the value of your offer.\n- **Consistency is Key:** Sporadic efforts won't cut it. Consistent marketing builds momentum.\n\nRevamp your marketing strategy to ensure your message is heard loud and clear.\n\n## 3. Poor Timing and Execution \u23f0\n\nThe 'when' and 'how' of your launch are as important as the 'what'. Consider these factors:\n\n- **Rushed Launch:** Did you launch prematurely? A well-prepared launch is often more successful.\n- **Market Environment:** Were there competing events or launches at the same time? Understanding the market landscape is crucial.\n- **Adaptability:** Are you flexible in your approach? Being able to pivot based on feedback is essential.\n\nReflect on the timing and execution of your launch. It's never too late to recalibrate and relaunch.\n\n## Wrapping Up \ud83c\udf1f\n\nRemember, a flop isn't the end. It's a stepping stone to your next success. By focusing on thorough market research, crafting an effective marketing strategy, and nailing the timing and execution, your next launch can soar high. Keep learning, adapting, and growing.

        "human_post": "# 3 Biggest Pricing Mistakes You May Not Know You're Making \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udeab\n\nHello, business owners! Are you working hard but not seeing the profits you expect? It might be time to reevaluate your pricing strategy. Often, pricing mistakes go unnoticed, yet they significantly impact your revenue. Let's uncover the three major pricing mistakes you might be making and how to correct them for your business's success.\n\n## 1. Pricing Solely Based on Costs \ud83d\udcca\n\n**The Mistake:** Many businesses set prices just by adding a markup to the cost. While cost is a factor, this method overlooks the perceived value of your product or service.\n\n**The Fix:** \n- **Value-Based Pricing:** Consider the value your product or service brings to customers. What problems does it solve? How does it improve their lives? Price based on this value.\n- **Customer Willingness to Pay:** Understand what your customers are willing to pay for the value you provide.\n\n## 2. Ignoring Market Trends and Competitors \ud83d\udcc9\n\n**The Mistake:** Not keeping an eye on market trends and what competitors are charging can lead to misaligned pricing.\n\n**The Fix:** \n- **Market Research:** Regularly research market trends and competitor pricing.\n- **Competitive Pricing Strategy:** Align your prices with the market while highlighting the unique value you offer.\n\n## 3. Fear of Raising Prices \ud83d\ude28\n\n**The Mistake:** Many businesses fear losing customers if they raise prices. However, not adjusting prices can lead to lost revenue and undervaluing your offerings.\n\n**The Fix:** \n- **Gradual Increases:** Implement small, gradual price increases.\n- **Transparency:** Communicate the reasons for price increases to your customers, such as improved features or rising operational costs.\n- **Focus on Loyal Customers:** Remember, customers who value your offerings are likely to stay despite price increases.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPricing isn't just about covering costs; it's a strategic tool that reflects the value of your offerings and positions you in the market. By avoiding these common mistakes, you can set prices that not only cover costs but also reflect the value you provide, stay competitive, and grow your profits. Review your pricing strategy, understand your market, and don't shy away from necessary adjustments. Your business's financial health depends on it! \ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udd11",

Are you working hard but not seeing the profits you expect? It might be time to reevaluate your pricing strategy. Often, pricing mistakes go unnoticed, yet they significantly impact your revenue. Let's uncover the three major pricing mistakes you might be making and how to correct them for your business's success.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">1. Pricing Solely Based on Costs \ud83d\udcca</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\"><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Many businesses set prices just by adding a markup to the cost. While cost is a factor, this method overlooks the perceived value of your product or service.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph-class\"><strong>The Fix:</strong> \n- <strong>Value-Based Pricing:</strong> Consider the value your product or service brings to customers. What problems does it solve? How does it improve their lives? Price based on this value.\n- <strong>Customer Willingness to Pay:</strong> Understand what your customers are willing to pay for the value you provide.</p>\n<h2 class=\"h2-class\">2.

We all know what it feels like when someone isn\u2019t authentic when selling, but do you know what\u2019s missing when this happens?\nIf you want to understand this difference and more importantly, how you can be more authentic in your sales process, you\u2019re in the right place...\nOn this episode, I'm going to be sharing a story that helps explain the key foundation piece that I believe is essential for all authentic sales conversations and really all authentic sales.
